41452255,Potential of exosomes for targeted therapy in neuroinfectious disease management: crossing the blood-brain barrier.,"Neuroinfectious diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis continue to be a significant health issue especially in low- and middle-income nations where the timely identification and successful treatment are mostly not yet available. There is also the complicating factor of the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which greatly limits the passage of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents through into the central nervous system. Exosomes which are nano-sized extracellular vesicles released by a vast variety of cells have been proposed as a promising solution to overcome this barrier because of their natural biocompatibility, low immunogenicity and capacity to enter the BBB by receptor-mediated, adsorptive-mediated and carrier-mediated processes. This review critically discusses the structural and functional dynamics of the BBB in infection, the recent discoveries in the exosome trafficking pathways, and the diagnostic and therapeutic role of exosomes in infection, including infections related to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, neurotoxoplasmosis. Special consideration will be given to engineered exosomes and how they could be used to improve targeted delivery of drugs, decrease systemic toxicity and offer minimally invasive biomarkers platforms to detect disease earlier. He/she points possible solutions to CNS infections by combining mechanistic understanding with newly acquired pre-clinical and clinical results, this review emphasizes the increasing promise of exosome-based nanomedicine as a transformational technology.","Bukke SPN, Yadav S, Prajapati S, Shobha Rani S, Reddy MS, Thalluri C, Chettupalli AK, Goruntla N, Pradeepkumar B, Eftekhari Z",2025,Tissue barriers,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41452255/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.6919,0.8919,YES

41443186,Biomarkers.,"Exosomes from brain cells, such as neuron-derived (NDEs) and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs), can cross the blood-brain barrier and be detected in peripheral circulation. These vesicles facilitate communication between the central nervous system (CNS), neuroendocrine, and immune systems, carrying miRNAs and proteins that are protected from degradation. While exosomes are well-studied in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), their role in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Late-Life Depression (LLD)-which may be prodromal stages of dementia-remains unclear. This project aims to identify biosignatures in NDEs, ADEs, and plasma to explore molecular profiles shared by LLD, MCI, and AD. We recruited 40 LLD subjects, 25 with MCI, 24 with AD, and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. After psychiatric evaluation, blood samples were collected, centrifuged to obtain platelet-free plasma, and stored at -80°C. Total exosomes were isolated using size exclusion chromatography and analyzed via NanoSight Pro nanotracking. NDEs and ADEs were quantified using the vFC™ vesicle flow cytometry kit on a CytoFlex system, while protein cargo was analyzed with Quanterix, SMCpro, and LX200. Five neuropsychiatric-associated miRNAs were assessed: miR-100-5p, miR-l-3p, miR-184, miR-221-3p, miR-766, and miR-5680. LLD and MCI showed no differences in NDEs and ADEs compared to controls, while AD had elevated levels. No microRNA differences were found between LLD and controls, but five of six miRNAs were reduced in AD. Proteomic analysis revealed persistent neuroinflammation in AD compared to LLD and MCI. These findings suggest compromised brain-periphery communication in MCI, LLD, and AD, highlighting exosomes as a window into the molecular pathology of these disorders.","Vieira E, Nikolova Y, Elmi S, Mendes-Silva AP, Kumar S, Diniz BS, Rajji TK",2025,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41443186/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.6001,0.8001,YES
41438685,CircRNAs: Novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diseases of the central nervous system.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of covalently closed, non-coding RNA molecules characterized by their exceptional stability and tissue-specific expression. Once considered splicing artifacts, they have emerged as pivotal regulators in cellular pathophysiology, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS), where they are highly abundant. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the biogenesis, molecular functions, and regulatory roles of circRNAs in major CNS disorders, underscores their significant potential as next-generation diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as promising therapeutic targets. Moving from bench to bedside, the review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of circRNA-based therapeutics. We assess the promise and limitations of current delivery platforms, including exosomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with special attention to the formidable challenge of traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To conclude, we outline the prevailing challenges and future perspectives, emphasizing that the development of more sensitive detection methods and optimized delivery systems is paramount to translating the immense potential of circRNAs into tangible clinical solutions for CNS diseases.","Cui J, Shen L, Han B",2026,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41438685/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.5389,0.7389,YES
41431712,Human umbilical cord plasma derived exosome inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and neuro-apoptosis in traumatic spinal cord injury model.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes severe functional impairments and involves both primary mechanical damage and secondary inflammation. Exosomes from human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) are emerging as promising therapies due to their bioactive components that regulate inflammation and support repair. Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A (laminectomy), Group B (contusion), Group C (contusion + PBS), and Group D (contusion + HUCB-exosomes). Contusion injuries were induced using the New York University (NYU) impactor method. HUCB-derived exosomes were extracted and confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface markers CD81 and CD9 via flowcytometry, along with dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential analysis. HUCB-exosomes were administered without prior in vitro expansion; 30 minutes' post-injury, Group D received 100 µg of HUCB-exosomes via tail vein injection for one week. Motor and behavioral functions were assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale, narrow beam test (NBT), rotarod test, and open-field test. Western blotting was performed eight weeks' post-injury to analyze changes in inflammatory cytokines, and histological changes were assessed via H&E staining. HUCB-exosome administration significantly enhanced functional recovery in SCI rats, as evidenced by higher BBB scores, improved narrow beam, rotarod, and open-field performances compared with PBS and contusion groups. Histological analysis showed reduced cavity formation, increased neuronal density, and decreased gliosis in the exosome-treated group. Western blot results revealed marked downregulation of TNF-α, NLRP3, and GFAP expression. Additionally, exosome therapy restored antioxidant balance by reducing ROS and GSSG levels while elevating GSH, and immunohistochemistry confirmed reduced expression of apoptotic and autophagy markers. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of HUCB-derived exosomes in SCI, demonstrating their ability to attenuate inflammation and promote functional recovery. These findings support HUCB-exosomes as a promising, non-cell-based treatment strategy for SCI.","Taheri H, Mosleh HR, Darabi L, Jahanbaz S, Mirni HK, Farahani RM, Aliaghaei A, Nazarian H, Bahar R, Hasanzadeh M",2026,3 Biotech,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41431712/,1,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.7624,1.0624,YES
41424243,Collagen-Based Hydrogel Loaded With Microspheres Encapsulated With Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes Synergistically Promote Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is a serious medical issue where there is a loss of sensorimotor function. Current interventions continue to lack the ability to successfully enhance these conditions; therefore, it is crucial to consider alternative effective strategies. Currently, we investigated the effects of collagen-based hydrogel (CbH) loaded with microspheres encapsulated with placental mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs)-derived exosomes in the recovery of TSCI in rats. Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 15/group): TSCI (injury without treatment), CbH, Microsphere (exosomes encapsulated in microspheres), and CbH + Microsphere. At 48 h, 10 rats per group were sacrificed for immunohistochemical (caspase-3), molecular (cytokines), and biochemical (oxidative stress markers) analyses; the remaining five rats per group were used for stereological evaluations at day 14. Furthermore, behavioral assessment was performed pre-injury and on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post-injuries. Results showed that the CbH + Microsphere group exhibited significantly reduced lesion volume and apoptosis, improved neuron preservation, and increased total volume compared to the TSCI group. Additionally, this group had higher levels of antioxidant enzymes (GSH, SOD, CAT) and IL-10, and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and MDA. Functional recovery, as reflected by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores, was significantly better in the CbH + Microsphere group across all time points post-injury. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CbH encapsulated with microspheres containing PMSCs-derived exosomes could enhance the prevention of injury spreading and the enhancement of pathological and behavioral symptoms when delivered to the location of spinal cord injury.","Zou J, Razali MH, Sun Z, Gao Y",2026,"Journal of biomedical materials research.

Hydrogels, bioabsorbable scaffolds comprising 3D hydrophilic polymers with high biocompatibility and some mechanical strength, offer a promising solution. Injectable thermosensitive hydrogels, transitioning from liquid to gel at body temperature, enable localized, sustained EXO delivery by forming biocompatible reservoirs at injury sites. These hydrogels enhance EXO retention and therapeutic efficacy through controlled release. In this review, we discuss MSC-EXO biology, hydrogel design (gelation mechanisms and fabrication), and applications of EXO-encapsulated thermosensitive hydrogels, emphasizing injectability, controlled release, and improved site-specific dosing. Future priorities involve refining EXO purification, optimizing hydrogel porosity and mechanical tunability, and assessing long-term safety and efficacy for clinical translation.","Wang B, Ren Y, Xiao X, Liu X, Wang Y, Wang Y",2025,Drug discovery today,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41418927/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5442,0.5442,YES
41403743,The Role of Autophagy in Long-term Effects of Spinal Cord Injury: Does Exosome Change the Autophagy Process and Vice Versa?,"This review explores the synergistic effects of exosomes and autophagy in mitigating spinal cord injury (SCI) while elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms. We evaluate current literature on the roles of exosomes and autophagy in SCI, highlighting key findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies. Previous research has demonstrated the contributions of these processes to cellular responses under SCI-related conditions. Additionally, animal models have provided insights into the therapeutic potential of modulating exosome and autophagy pathways. The overview discusses the activation of mTOR signaling and autophagy-related proteins, emphasizing their impacts on inflammation and axonal integrity. We identify a synergistic mechanism in which exosome-mediated cargo delivery and autophagy modulation work together to mitigate the effects of SCI. The regulation of the mTOR pathway and autophagy-related proteins is crucial for reducing inflammation and preserving axonal integrity. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting exosomes and autophagy for SCI treatment. The collaborative actions of these cellular processes present promising therapeutic avenues for SCI and possibly other neurological disorders. This review underscores the necessity for further studies to unravel the molecular intricacies and to translate these findings into clinical applications for SCI patients.","Akbari-Gharalari N, Ebrahimi-Kalan A, Aliyari-Serej Z, Soltani Zangbar H, Ghahremani-Nasab M, Yahyavi Y, Ebrahimi A, Aghaei N, Nezhadshahmohammad F",2025,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41403743/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6465,0.9465,YES
41403229,Exosomes from LPS-stimulated macrophages alleviate neuroinflammatory responses by reducing pyroptosis in systemic lipopolysaccharide-induced mice.,"Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation occurs in cognitive dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The newly discovered pattern of cell death in recent years is called pyroptosis, which is distinguished from apoptosis and necrosis, and is mainly dependent on caspase-1 mediated inflammatory response. Stem-derived exosomes have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the exosomes (Ex) secreted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages (LPS-Ex) to attenuate the neuroinflammatory response caused by systemic LPS stimulation by attenuating pyroptosis. We studied lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 mice by behavioral testing, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and other methods. We found that LPS-Ex can reduce the level of inflammatory factors, down-regulate the pyroptosis pathway and the inflammatory pathway of NF-κB, and improve the inflammatory response of neurological function in mice. The conclusion is that LPS-Ex relieves neuroinflammation by reducing pyroptosis. It can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection and functional recovery in the onset of central nervous system inflammation.","Ying T, Sun Z",2025,Journal of applied biomedicine,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41403229/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5972,0.7972,YES

41386609,Injectable multifunctional quaternized carboxymethyl chitosan-hyaluronic acid hydrogel loaded with exosomes from microglia overexpressing miR-124-3p for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to be a significant worldwide health issue because of the blood-brain barrier's restrictive properties and the limited distribution of therapeutic agents, highlighting the necessity for brain-compatible biomaterials capable of attenuating neuroinflammation and supporting neural recovery. In this work, we developed a multifunctional injectable hydrogel (QCC/OHM@Exos<sup>miR-124</sup>) incorporating microglia-derived exosomes enriched with miR-124-3p to modulate post-injury inflammation through inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. The hydrogel, formulated from quaternized carboxymethyl chitosan (QCC) and oxidized methacrylated hyaluronic acid (OHM), exhibited excellent biocompatibility, injectability, antibacterial activity, and mechanical compliance with brain tissue. In vitro, QCC/OHM@Exos<sup>miR-124</sup> suppressed proinflammatory cytokine expression and aided the shift of microglia from the M1 phenotype to the M2 phenotype. In vivo, using a mouse model with controlled cortical impact (CCI), treatment markedly improved neurological performance, including locomotor coordination and both short- and long-term memory. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses further revealed reduced neuroinflammatory responses and enhanced neuronal survival. Collectively, these findings suggest that QCC/OHM@Exos<sup>miR-124</sup> serves as a promising biomaterial platform for TBI therapy by establishing a neuroprotective microenvironment and regulating inflammatory signaling. Future studies will aim to refine exosome delivery and evaluate translational feasibility.","Yang J, Zhang Y, Tang Z, Wang J, Chen Y, Shen J, Zhang Y, Liu J, Du L, Jin Y",2025,International journal of biological macromolecules,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41386609/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5016,0.6016,YES
41379301,The Potential of Neural Stem Cell-derived Exosomes for the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke.,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, posing a significant threat to human health. Neural stem cells possess the remarkable capabilities of self-renewal and differentiation into diverse neural cell types, endowing them with significant potential for the restoration of damaged neural tissues and functions. Exosomes, which carry a multitude of bioactive substances, serve as crucial tools for intercellular communication. Neural stem cell-derived exosomes are capable of engaging in the modulation of various physiological functions, presenting a highly promising novel approach for the treatment of ischemic stroke. This paper elaborates on the pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic stroke, the engineering strategies for exosomes, and the prospects and limitations of neural stem cell transplantation therapies. It systematically reviews the potential roles of neural stem cell-derived exosomes in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that neural stem cell-derived exosomes can contribute to brain targeting, promote neural regeneration and angiogenesis, suppress neuroinflammation, and enhance the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, their efficacy is constrained by insufficient targeting precision and limited cargo content. To improve the therapeutic efficacy of neural stem cell-derived exosomes, strategies such as surface modification and cargo loading can be employed. These include attaching targeting peptides, proteins, and antibodies to the exosome surface via chemical modification and genetic engineering, as well as loading small-molecule drugs and nanomaterials. Furthermore, accelerating the clinical translation of exosomes requires strict adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices. Neural stem cell-derived exosomes hold substantial potential in the treatment of ischemic stroke, which is expected to promote the development of the field of neural regeneration and bring new hope for more central nervous system diseases.","Deng X, Xie X, Zhu T, Chen C",2025,Stem cell reviews and reports,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41379301/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.7106,0.9106,YES
41372929,MiR499-5P loaded MSC derived exosomes affect oxidative stress and inflammatory response after spinal cord injury by targeting genes.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe and prevalent disorder of the central nervous system that leads to sensory and motor dysfunction, with approximately 700,000 new cases reported annually. Recently, miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks have garnered significant attention from researchers. Preliminary evidence from animal models and bioinformatic analyses suggests that altered miRNA expression affects critical pathophysiological processes in SCI. Therefore, the miRNA-target gene interaction network holds promise as a potential therapeutic avenue to promote neural recovery post-SCI. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MSC-EXO-miR499-5P can protect neurons and promote the recovery of motor function in SCI mice. First, we selected the GSE2599 dataset through bioinformatic analysis and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package. Subsequently, we focused on the upregulated DEGs enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. Following the comparative analysis, miR499-5P was selected for further in vitro and in vivo investigations. Subsequent evaluations demonstrated that MSC-EXO-miR499-5P promoted cell growth, alleviated post-injury oxidative stress and inflammation, and contributed to the repair of the spinal cord microenvironment while enhancing functional recovery in SCI mice. In summary, our findings suggest that MSC-EXO containing miR499-5P represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of SCI.","Pang L, Qi L, Wang H, Zhu T, Wang Y",2025,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41372929/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6015,0.9015,YES
41369342,Orthobiologics and Peptide Therapy for Central Nervous System Repair in Neurodegenerative Conditions.,"Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease remain the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging and continue to lack curative treatments. Their pathophysiology is often multifaceted, encompassing protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic neuroinflammation, synaptic degeneration, and vascular compromise. This complex landscape reduces the effectiveness of single-target pharmacological agents and underscores the need for therapies capable of acting across multiple axes. Orthobiologics and peptide-based strategies exemplify this approach. Autologous cellular alternatives such as platelet-rich plasma, bone marrow aspirates, mesenchymal stromal cell derivatives, and extracellular vesicles deliver paracrine signals that can reprogram glia, preserve mitochondrial function, and promote synaptic and vascular repair. Peptide therapeutics, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and novel sequences targeting protein aggregation or mitochondrial pathways, provide complementary precision by engaging defined receptors and intracellular cascades. Together, these modalities converge on mechanisms central to circuit preservation rather than symptomatic relief alone. Preclinical studies across Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease demonstrate consistent neuroprotective and functional benefits, and early human trials support feasibility and safety. The translational path forward requires standardized preparation, biomarker integration, optimized delivery routes such as intranasal administration, and regulatory frameworks adapted to biologic therapies. This review synthesizes current evidence on orthobiologics and peptides in neurodegeneration, outlines safety and translational considerations, and highlights future directions, including rational combinations and biomarker-driven trials. By uniting the broad signaling capacity of orthobiologics with the precision of peptides, neurology can move beyond symptomatic care toward regenerative strategies that aim to preserve neural circuits and improve long-term outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.","de Oliveira CAA, Oliveira BS, Oliveira AS, de Souza Loduca RD, Junior CRM, Santos GS",2025,Cells,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41369342/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4818,0.6818,YES
41368286,"Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes in Anti-NET Therapy: Mechanisms, Challenges, and Future Perspectives.","Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in immune responses. In 2004, Brinkmann et al identified neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as a novel antibacterial mechanism. However, NETs have since been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, sepsis, and cancer. Consequently, targeting NETs has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated efficacy in modulating NET formation, but MSC-derived exosomes offer distinct advantages over whole MSCs due to their lower immunogenicity, higher biological stability, and ability to deliver bioactive molecules like miRNAs and CD59. These exosomes can block critical signaling pathways involved in NET formation and protect neutrophil mitochondria, inhibiting NET release. Despite challenges such as low yield and targeting efficiency, ongoing research has made significant strides in addressing these issues. This article reviews the current progress in MSC-derived exosome-based anti-NET therapies and discusses potential strategies to enhance their therapeutic application.","Ye Y, Ye Y, Tian M, Zhao Y, Guo Z, Jin C, Duan S, Zheng Y",2025,International journal of nanomedicine,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41368286/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5411,0.5411,YES
41361856,The profiling of extracellular vesicle subtypes in Huntington's disease brains identifies Alix as a novel marker of neuropathology.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is the most frequent autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Despite its well-defined genetic origin, there is currently no cure, and reliable biomarkers for disease progression and pathophysiology remain limited. Mutant huntingtin protein accumulates in endosomal compartments, disrupting endosomal trafficking and potentially affecting the biogenesis, release, and cargo of exosomes-extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the endosomal pathway. However, the role of exosomes in HD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers has been underexplored. In this work, we investigated whether the levels and content of small EV subpopulations, including exosomes, are altered in the brains of HD patients. We analyzed two distinct subpopulations of small EVs from the striatum and cortex of postmortem HD brains at early and advanced neuropathological stages, as well as from age-matched controls. EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and high-resolution iodixanol density gradient centrifugation, and analyzed by Western blotting, electron microscopy, NTA, and proteomics using mass spectrometry. EV secretion was also analyzed in primary fibroblasts derived from HD patients and healthy controls. Mass spectrometry data revealed HD-associated alterations in EV protein content, particularly proteins related to the endosomal system. Our data also indicate that the level of ectosomes increased in the HD cortex, whereas exosomes were reduced in both the HD striatum and cortex compared to controls. In terms of EV content, EVs from HD brains showed increased levels of Annexin A2 and decreased levels of Alix, a key component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Alix depletion in EVs mirrored a progressive reduction of Alix in brain tissue, correlating with disease severity based on Vonsattel staging. In vitro, HD fibroblasts secreted EVs with reduced Alix content, despite no significant difference in cellular Alix levels compared to controls. These findings highlight disease-specific changes in EV populations and cargo in HD, and identify Alix as a potential neuropathological marker. This study advances our understanding of the role of brain-derived EVs in HD and underscores their potential utility in biomarker discovery.","Pérez-González R, Vázquez-Oliver A, Salvat-Rovira N, Martínez-Horta S, Rivas-Asensio E, Borràs E, Ortuño-Miquel S, Sánchez-Carcelén M, Garcia-Forn M, Sampedro F",2025,Acta neuropathologica communications,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41361856/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5664,0.5664,YES

Its pathophysiological mechanisms encompass various factors, including dysregulated inflammatory responses, endothelial injury and microcirculatory disturbances, abnormal activation of cell death pathways, as well as metabolic reprogramming and immune interactions. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the earliest and most susceptible organs affected during the septic process. This involvement not only results in brain dysfunction due to neuronal damage, excessive activation of microglia, and neuroinflammatory responses but also contributes to systemic organ damage through diverse neural regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, the CNS influences the function of distant organs via the autonomic nervous system-comprising inhibition of the vagus nerve cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and excessive activation of sympathetic nerve pathways-the neuroimmune regulatory network, central trained immunity regulation, extravasation of brain-derived inflammatory factors, and exosome transport. This paper provides a systematic review of key pathogenic mechanisms underlying sepsis-related organ damage while emphasizing the pivotal regulatory role played by the central nervous system in this pathological process along with its potential therapeutic implications.","Tang F, Wu S, Zou Z, Li X, Qiao L",2025,Frontiers in immunology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41357214/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5074,0.8074,YES
41351366,Combined intrathecal and intravenous exosome injection efficiency in a multiple sclerosis patient: a case report.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with limited treatment efficacy for progressive forms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted exosomes offer therapeutic potential via regenerative and immunomodulatory actions, including T-cell suppression and neurotrophic factor secretion. Exosomes, as cell-free alternatives, may mediate MSC effects by delivering cargo such as microRNAs, potentially promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and blood-brain barrier stabilization with reduced immunogenicity. Preclinical experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models and early MSC clinical trials demonstrate promise in reducing disease severity, although optimization of exosome sources, delivery routes (intrathecal versus intravenous), dosing, and standardization remains a challenge for clinical translation. Here, we describe a 44-year-old female with a 21-year history of progressive MS unresponsive to interferon beta-1a and Ocrelizumab, who presented with widespread neurological deficits, including sensory disturbances, weakness, and urge incontinence. Examination revealed ataxia, intention tremor, and hyperreflexia, with previous MRIs confirming MS plaques. In 2025, she received allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC exosomes (1 cc intrathecally; 1 cc intravenously at half dose) with adjunctive intravenous laser therapy. Within three weeks, she reported 70-80% symptomatic improvement, including resolution of Lhermitte's sign and enhanced muscle strength, vision, memory, and energy. Two-month follow-up MRIs showed persistent lesions without new contrast enhancement, indicating no active disease progression. This case highlights significant symptomatic improvement in long-standing progressive MS following combined intrathecal and intravenous allogeneic UC-MSC exosome administration. The rapid clinical benefits and absence of new MRI activity suggest a potential modulatory role for exosome therapy in MS, although these encouraging findings from a single case with adjunctive therapy necessitate larger, controlled clinical trials to validate efficacy, safety, and optimal protocols, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms.","Mohammad Jafari A, Sadegi K, Kaveh M, Zandi Mehran Y, Weber M, Golestanha SA, Hoseinzade F, Tafazoli Harandi N, Ayazi M, Weber HM",2025,"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41351366/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.574,0.674,YES

Exosomes, naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs), have gained attention as innovative drug delivery vehicles owing to their intrinsic ability to cross the BBB, minimal immunogenicity, high biocompatibility, and capability to carry diverse therapeutic cargos such as proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules. Furthermore, exosomes can be bioengineered to enhance drug-loading efficiency and targeting specificity, positioning them as a versatile and effective platform for treating NDDs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in exosome biogenesis, secretion, and engineering, with an emphasis on innovative strategies for exosome isolation, drug loading, and surface modification.

41327445,Human neural stem cell-derived exosomes promote functional recovery in subarachnoid hemorrhage via bdnf/trkb pathway activation and astrocyte modulation.,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating neurological condition with limited therapeutic options for mitigating secondary brain injury. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of exosomes derived from human neural stem cells (hNSC-exo) in a rat SAH model, focusing on their molecular mechanisms through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transcriptomic profiling. This study demonstrated that hNSC-exo administration significantly ameliorated neurological deficits, reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and attenuated neuronal damage post-SAH. Behavioral assessments revealed improved cognitive and motor recovery in hNSC-exo-treated rats, supported by histopathological evidence of preserved neuronal architecture and reduced edema. scRNA-seq analysis revealed a marked increase in astrocyte proportions and vitality following hNSC-exo treatment, alongside suppression of neurotoxic microglial activation. Transcriptomic profiling identified the BDNF/TRKB signaling pathway as a critical mediator, with hNSC-exo upregulating BDNF and TRKB expression both in vivo and in vitro. Functional validation confirmed that hNSC-exo enhanced astrocyte survival via BDNF/TRKB activation, while knockdown of BDNF or TRKB reversed these protective effects. Furthermore, hNSC-exo mitigated neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-18) and microglial C1q expression. These findings highlight hNSC-exo as a novel therapeutic strategy for SAH, leveraging astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection and BDNF/TRKB pathway activation to counteract secondary injury. This study provides mechanistic insights into exosome-based therapies and underscores their potential for clinical translation in cerebrovascular disorders.","Zhang X, Jing F, Li J, Bai Y, Guo C, Jin H, Dong Y, Liang G",2025,Acta neuropathologica communications,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41327445/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6008,0.7008,YES

Lipid-based nanocarriers, including liposomes, cubosomes, and nanostructured lipid carriers, have emerged as versatile nose-to-brain platforms offering rapid CNS access, dual encapsulation of synthetic and plant-derived neuroprotective agents, and tunable release kinetics. This review bridges nanoscale material design (<i>e.g.</i>, lipid crystallinity, phase transitions, hybridization with plant exosomes) with intranasal transport pathways and therapeutic outcomes in PD. We highlight multifunctional innovations such as stimuli-responsive lipid systems, exosome-cubosome hybrids, and AI-guided formulation modeling coupled with microfluidic manufacturing. By linking mechanistic insights with translational hurdles-including safety and regulatory challenges-we provide a forward-looking roadmap for next-generation nanotherapies poised to redefine PD management and accelerate clinical translation.","Wafik Nabih N, Nafie MS, Babker A, Alameen AAM, Fahmy SA",2025,Nanoscale,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41321255/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5276,0.7276,YES
41316483,Exosomes derived from menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and treadmill training restore motor function following SCI by activating PI3K/Akt pathway.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a global challenge due to limited neural regeneration and functional recovery. Emerging therapies, such as mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes and exercise training, have shown promise, but their individual efficacy is insufficient. The synergistic effects of menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MenSCs-Exo) and weight-supported treadmill training (WSTT) in SCI repair remain unclear. This study investigated their combined therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in SCI rats. A T10 spinal cord hemisection model was conducted in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomized into five groups: Sham, SCI, Exo (200 µg MenSCs-Exo via tail vein injection every 48 h for 4 doses), TT (WSTT starting on day 3 post-SCI), and Exo + TT. Motor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and CatWalk XT<sup>®</sup> gait analysis. Histological assessments included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, immunofluorescence for β-tubulin III (Tuj1) and myelin basic protein (MBP), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blot analyzed fibrosis-related proteins (COL1, COL3, α-SMA) and PI3K/AKT pathway activation (p-AKT, PI3K, β-catenin, LEF1). Combined Exo + TT significantly improved motor function compared to monotherapies. BBB scores in the Exo + TT group were higher than SCI controls from day 7, with marked differences at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). CatWalk analysis revealed enhanced hindlimb coordination, reduced dragging, and improved paw print parameters in Exo + TT rats. Histologically, Exo + TT reduced spinal cord cavitation, inflammation, and fibrosis (P < 0.01 vs. SCI), while promoting axonal (Tuj1) and myelin (MBP) regeneration with ordered structure. TEM showed preserved myelin lamellae and reduced axonal degeneration. Western blot confirmed decreased COL1, COL3, and α-SMA expression, along with upregulated p-Akt, PI3K, β-catenin, and LEF1 in Exo + TT rats (P < 0.01). MenSCs-Exo combined with WSTT synergistically enhances motor recovery after SCI by promoting tissue repair, reducing fibrosis, and activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. This cell-free therapy paired with rehabilitation exercise offers a novel strategy for SCI treatment.","Wang QH, Shi YH, Zhang LY, Jiang WW, Pu YX, Chen SY, Song HQ, Dai JQ, Chen JX, Liu JY",2025,Stem cell research & therapy,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41316483/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6267,0.9267,YES
41310241,Advances in Intranasal Delivery of Exosomes for Central Nervous System Disorders.,"Central nervous system disorders are major global health challenges that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional therapeutic strategies often face substantial limitations, primarily due to the blood-brain barrier, which restricts the delivery of pharmacological agents to the brain and consequently affects treatment effectiveness. In recent years, in order to enhance the efficacy of the central nervous system treatments, exosome-based approaches have gained interest. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm) secreted by cells, present a feasible therapeutic strategy due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and transport bioactive molecules. Reflecting the traits of their parent cells (e.g., glioma stem cells and glioblastoma multiforme), exosomes can be isolated from body fluids, which enhances their clinical applicability. Additionally, intranasal delivery provides a non-invasive method to administer exosomes, using the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways to bypass the blood-brain barrier and directly target the brain. This method shows great promise in enhancing therapeutic efficacy for CNS disorders. However, challenges such as rapid mucociliary clearance, enzymatic degradation, and limited bioavailability reduce efficacy. Advances in exosome engineering, nanocarrier systems, and novel delivery devices are under investigation to mitigate these constraints. However, clinical translation requires further research to guarantee safety, consistency, and scalability. In this context, intranasal exosome delivery holds considerable promise as a non-invasive strategy for central nervous system disorder treatment, contingent on overcoming the current biological and technical barriers.","Arjmand B, Mojavezi AR, Kamroo A, Yazdi RK, Rezaei-Tavirani M, Vahedi MS",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41310241/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.7659,0.9659,YES
41304793,Modern Approaches and Emerging Biological Therapies to Treat Fracture Nonunion.,"Fracture nonunion remains an unresolved complication after extremity fracture, with notable costs to patient quality of life and health systems. Nonunion is defined by the inability of fracture ends to unite without evidence of progressive healing over time. Approximately 2 to 10% of all fractures go onto nonunion, with increased rates observed in specific fracture locations and patient populations. Despite advances in fixation techniques and bone grafting, current treatments remain limited and frequently fail to restore durable bone healing. In this review, the current state of emerging biologic and bioengineering therapies for nonunion will be summarized, with a focus on how these advances may shift treatment from palliative reconstruction toward durable healing. Biological therapies such as growth factors, stem cells, and gene-modified constructs show promise but face challenges of short half-life, inconsistent efficacy, and safety concerns. Emerging approaches, including controlled-release scaffolds, immunomodulatory materials, stem cell-derived exosomes, and gene therapy platforms, offer opportunities to more precisely restore the osteogenic, angiogenic, and immunologic environment required for union.","Wier J, Shelby H, Bergren S, Patterson JT, Lieberman JR",2025,Pharmaceutics,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41304793/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5011,0.5011,YES

Microfluidic technology offers significant advantages for non-invasive liquid biopsy, particularly in the analysis of tumor progression markers carried by exosomes. Here, we developed an integrated microfluidic system for the sensitive, accurate, totally on-chip exosome isolation and automatic quantification of tumor progression markers PD-L1 and MMP9. This platform leverages microfluidic design principles for efficient sample mixing and monodisperses microbeads for precise analysis, allowing for complete processing within 40 min. The system's high efficiency and precision are further enhanced by a lightweight YOLOv5-based positional migration strategy that automates fluorescence quantification. Validation using four different cell lines demonstrated distinct exosomal protein signatures with a low detection limit of 12.58 particles/μL.

41298994,miR-132 and Its Exosomal Form in Alzheimer's Disease: Linking Epigenetic Regulation to Neurodegeneration.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by distinct neuropathological features, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, synaptic dysfunction, and chronic neuroinflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as critical post-transcriptional regulators, exert a profound influence on central nervous system (CNS) function and are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Among these, miR-132 stands out as a brain-enriched miRNA that is consistently downregulated in AD, affecting various aspects of the disease, from Aβ and tau pathologies to synaptic integrity and neuronal survival. Simultaneously, exosomes, nanoscale extracellular vesicles, play a crucial role in intercellular communication and are capable of transporting miRNAs across biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current understanding of miR-132's intrinsic roles in neuronal health and its dysregulation in AD, elucidates the mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated communication, and explores the complex interplay between exosomal miR-132 and AD pathology. Furthermore, we examine the significant role of epigenetic regulation in modulating miR-132 expression and its broader implications for neurodegeneration. By evaluating the diagnostic potential of miR-132 and its exosomal form as non-invasive biomarkers, as well as their promising therapeutic applications, this review underscores the multifaceted importance of miR-132 in AD. Challenges in current research, particularly with regard to the standardization of exosome isolation methods and the complexity of miRNA regulatory networks, are discussed, highlighting the need for future comprehensive studies to translate these findings into effective clinical strategies for AD management.","Oriquat G, Abdulsahib WK, Jyothi SR, Nayak PP, Chauhan AS, Singla S, Sead FF, Polatova D",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41298994/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5041,0.7041,YES
41291855,Exosomes from CD133<sup>+</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> human urine-derived stem cells combined with a novel photosensitive hydrogel promote repair after spinal cord injury.,"Failed regeneration following severe spinal cord injury (SCI) results from both the limited intrinsic regenerative capacity of adult neurons and an inhibitory local microenvironment. Exosome-based cell-free therapy derived from stem cells is a safer and more promising regenerative strategy. In this study, we isolated extracellular vesicles from a urine-derived stem cell subpopulation and incorporated them into an injectable, photosensitive, and highly biocompatible methacrylated carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCSMA) hydrogel to investigate their therapeutic potential for promoting functional recovery after SCI and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Human urine-derived stem cells (hUSCs) were initially isolated and cultured from human urine samples. The CD133<sup>+</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> subpopulation (CD133<sup>+</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>hUSCs) was identified and sorted using flow cytometry. Exosomes derived from this stem cell subpopulation (hUSC-sExos) were subsequently isolated from cell culture supernatants and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle size analysis, and Western blotting. To achieve localized sustained delivery, we developed a novel CMSCMA-sExo hydrogel composite scaffold using a photosensitive CMSCMA hydrogel as the carrier matrix and systematically evaluated its therapeutic efficacy through integrated in vivo and in vitro studies to assess microvascular regeneration, blood‒spinal cord barrier functional restoration, neural remodeling, and ultimately neurological functional recovery. The hUSCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73 and CD90 but negative for CD34 and CD45. Compared with hUSCs, the CD133<sup>+</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup>hUSC subpopulation exhibited significantly enhanced proliferative capacity and trilineage differentiation potential, indicating greater stemness characteristics. Further investigation revealed that the novel CMSCMA-sExo hydrogel composite scaffold significantly improved the tube formation and migration capacity of spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells, promoted microvascular regeneration, enhanced axonal regeneration and synaptic remodeling, and ultimately led to functional neurological recovery. The novel injectable CMSCMA-sExo hydrogel composite scaffold may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating SCI using urine-derived stem cell subpopulation exosomes.","Deng C, Yuan F, Li C, Tong X, Qin Y, Wen H, Qin T, Liu Y, Wu T, Duan C",2025,Journal of translational medicine,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41291855/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6107,0.9107,YES

Current treatments for IBS have notable limitations, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies to address chronic visceral pain and associated comorbidities. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to investigate whether bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) can alleviate chronic visceral pain in IBS and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, with a specific focus on the Nrf-2/HO-1 oxidative stress pathway. High-quality BMSC-Exos were isolated and characterized. In vitro, their neuroprotective effects were assessed in oxidatively stressed neurons. In vivo, IBS model rats received intrathecal injections of BMSC-Exos, and their effects on visceral pain sensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated. Spinal cord tissues were analyzed to determine modulation of the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway. In vitro studies demonstrated that BMSC-Exos effectively rescued oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage. In IBS rats, intrathecally administered BMSC-Exos were internalized by spinal cord neurons, significantly reducing visceral hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, BMSC-Exos upregulated the Nrf-2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway, mitigating oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage. These findings demonstrate that BMSC-Exos alleviate chronic visceral pain and comorbid anxiety in IBS rats, likely through Nrf-2/HO-1-mediated oxidative stress reduction in spinal neurons. These results highlight BMSC-Exos as a promising acellular therapeutic strategy for IBS, offering potential applications for this debilitating disorder.","Liu Y, Li M, Lian X, Chen X, Lin C, Jin L, You J, Lai Y, Liu L, Zhu Y",2025,Pain reports,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41280947/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5437,0.7437,YES

Their role in musculoskeletal health and diseases has recently drawn significant attention. This review focuses on the latest EV research in musculoskeletal diseases, including their roles in disease progression and potential as biomarkers and therapies. Musculoskeletal disorders are the third-leading cause of global disability-adjusted life-years among adolescents and young adults. Current treatments face issues like limited tissue regeneration and poor drug targeting. With their natural messenger function and low immunogenicity, EVs have become a research focus. However, their action mechanisms in the musculoskeletal system remain un-systematically understood. This paper reviews EVs' role in musculoskeletal diseases. It covers classification, biogenesis, release, internalization, cargo and their involvement in muscle cell processes, joint diseases, bone metabolism and disc degeneration. It also explores EVs' role in musculoskeletal crosstalk and their potential as therapeutic agents and drug carriers through engineering with biomaterials.

41273479,"Targeting Ischemic Stroke with Neural Stem Cells: Insights into Endogenous Repair Mechanisms, Biomaterial-Based Delivery, and Exosome Therapies.","Neurological diseases, such as stroke, are typically deemed refractory because of the adult mammalian brain's poor ability to self-repair and regenerate, resulting in irreparable cellular damage. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have distinct capabilities to regenerate themselves and differentiate into several types of neural lineage cells, including neurons and glial cells, making them valuable in the treatment of stroke. They are capable of differentiating into neurons and glial cells, which establish themselves within the integrated circuitry of neural networks and restore functions. NSCs can also facilitate beneficial alterations indirectly, by secreting neurotrophic factors and exosomes that promote neuronal survival, angiogenesis, and dampen inflammation. NSCs promote an endogenous adaptive immune response toward a neuroprotective state, which enhances repair processes and reduces the impact of ischemic inflammation. Nevertheless, significant obstacles faced by directly transplanted NSCs are their limited survival and unpredictable differentiation in vivo. In order to address the constraints of directly transplanted NSCs and considering the pathological characteristics of stroke including the loss of a certain cell type, extensive research has focused on investigating the possibility of enhancing the in vivo survival, migration, and differentiation of NSCs. In light of this, different strategies, such as preconditioning of NSCs, using NSC exosome, and also cell delivery by biomaterials, have gained significant interest. In this study, we delve into current advancements in harnessing NSC capacities to enhance neurogenesis and induce neuroprotection in stroke.","Hassanzadeh A, Rahbarghazi R, Verdi J, Mahmoudi J, Moghadam MH, Mousakhani A, Vousooghi N, Karimipour M",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41273479/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5587,0.6587,YES

In neuroscience, one of the most important and well-characterized EV subtypes is exosomes. However, current issues with EV nomenclature make it difficult to draw firm conclusions due to variability in usage across different studies. One solution to overcome this challenge is to use established markers for isolating different types of CNS-derived EVs. This article provides an up-to-date list of potential EV markers, focusing on surface markers. We discuss the role of EVs in CNS diseases and explore each candidate's potential to be used as a specific EV surface marker. We also highlight how non-adherence to EV nomenclature leads to confusion and misuse of EV markers. Additional challenges in EV research, such as isolation methods and the lack of comparative studies between plasma and tissue-derived EVs, are discussed. Providing a list of new possible CNS-derived EV marker candidates can lead to more precise isolation and description of EVs, thereby enhancing our understanding of EV signaling and advancing our knowledge of neurological diseases.","Gruzdev S, Yakovlev A",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41269455/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6095,0.9095,YES

41249917,Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes alleviate antibiotic-induced intestinal barrier damage by regulating autophagy via the S100G/mTOR signaling pathway.,"Antibiotics are a double-edged sword. Long-term, broad-spectrum, and high-dose antibiotic use can lead to the occurrence of related diseases, particularly attracting attention in the context of intestinal barrier damage. However, current clinical treatments remain suboptimal. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal/stem cell-derived exosomes (HucMSCs-Exo) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in tissue repair and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, studies on their role in antibiotic-induced intestinal barrier damage remain limited. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of HucMSCs-Exo in treating antibiotic-induced intestinal mucosal barrier damage. A mouse model of antibiotic-induced intestinal barrier damage was established by administering clindamycin hydrochloride via gavage for 28 consecutive days in C57BL/6 male mice. The therapeutic effects of HucMSCs-Exo were evaluated through intraperitoneal injections at low and high concentrations every other day. Transcriptomic sequencing and other techniques were used to identify target genes and mechanistic pathways involved in HucMSCs-Exo mediated repair of intestinal mucosal barrier damage. Finally, the findings were validated in vitro using human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells. The in vivo mouse experiments demonstrated that HucMSCs-Exo effectively alleviated antibiotic-induced intestinal barrier damage. Both low- and high-concentration exosome treatments improved the antibiotic-induced reduction in body weight gain, shortened colon length,disrupted intestinal epithelial continuity, increased permeability owing to microvilli structural damage, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1). The in vitro cell experiments further showed that both low- and high-concentration exosome treatments restored antibiotic-induced reductions in cell proliferation and migration, as well as increased autophagy and apoptosis, with the high-concentration group showing significant differences (p < 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis of mouse colonic tissues revealed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in autophagy-related and apoptosis-related pathways, with S100G identified as a potential target gene of HucMSCs-Exo. Knockdown of the S100G gene in NCM460 cells yielded results consistent with the HucMSCs-Exo treatment group, indicating that HucMSCs-Exo exerts its effects by promoting mTOR phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting excessive autophagy. HucMSCs-Exo alleviates antibiotic-induced intestinal mucosal barrier damage by inhibiting excessive autophagy-mediated apoptosis via the S100G/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings elucidate the role and mechanism of exosomes in antibiotic-induced intestinal mucosal barrier damage, providing new insights for the therapeutic potential of exosomes in related fields.","Guo Y, Li Y, Shi M, Li Y, Qiang J, Li J, Gao H, Zhu G, Xie B, Guo X",2025,Cellular & molecular biology letters,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41249917/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4792,0.4792,YES
41247551,Neuroprotective Effects of Platelet-Derived Exosomes in a Rat Model of Methamphetamine-Induced Neurotoxicity.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant that induces severe neurotoxicity, leading to long-lasting cognitive and affective impairments. Despite its widespread abuse, effective therapeutic strategies for reversing METH-induced neural damage remain limited. Platelet-derived exosomes (pExos) have recently emerged as promising cell-free candidates for neurorestorative therapies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pExos in a rat model of chronic methamphetamine addiction. Then, 36 male Wistar rats were divided into three experimental groups. The treatment group received METH coadministered with platelet exosomes. After 10 days, a series of behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the treatment's effect on memory, learning, depression, and anxiety-like behaviors. These tests included the Morris water maze, Novel object recognition, Elevated plus maze, and Forced swimming test. The rat hippocampus was evaluated by several methods including Nissl staining, Immunohistochemical assay for Caspase-3, Ki-67, Iba1, and qRT-PCR for Bax and Bcl2 gene expression analysis. Furthermore, the concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as the levels of several oxidative stress markers were assessed. Treatment with pExos significantly improved learning, spatial memory retention, and recognition performance in METH-treated rats (P < 0.05). Also, pExos reduced depression and anxiety-like behaviors (P < 0.01). These behavioral enhancements were accompanied by reduced apoptosis, neuronal cell loss, and restoration of hippocampal cell proliferation. Additionally, a reduction in inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress was demonstrated following exosome therapy (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that pExos offer a multifaceted neuroprotective effect against METH-induced brain injury by modulating apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal cell proliferation. Given their safety, accessibility, and efficacy, pExos could be a promising therapeutic platform to address substance-induced neurocognitive disorders.","Mohtashami T, Atashi A, Garmabi B, Khaksari M",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41247551/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5564,0.6564,YES

This study aims to engineer BMSC-derived exosomes to deliver the miR-17-5p inhibitor, synergistically enhancing axonal regeneration, restoring sensory processing in an SDCL rat model, and elucidating mechanisms. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify critical pathways associated with the neuroregenerative effects of EXOs. The delivery efficiency of EXOs was assessed by RT-qPCR. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate EXO internalization and axonal regeneration potential. Key proteins were validated via western blotting and ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and the Tape Removal Test were utilized to evaluate the efficacy of neural injury repair. Transcriptomic (p.adjust = 0.003) and miRNomic (p.adjust = 0.0008) analyses suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway may play a pivotal role in the neuroregenerative effects of EXOs. Following the repair efficacy validation of both the miR-17-5p inhibitor and BMSC-derived EXOs, EXOs carrying the miR-17-5p inhibitor more effectively enhance DRG neuron axonal outgrowth (309.36 ± 24.63 μm; p < 0.0001) and restore sensory conduction in SDCL rats (%Area positive = 78.59 ± 8.20 %; p < 0.0001) through the IL-11/GP130/STAT3/GAP-43 axis. BMSC-derived EXOs loaded with the miR-17-5p inhibitor synergistically promote axonal growth and restore sensory conduction in SDCL rats through the IL-11/GP130/STAT3/GAP-43 axis. This study integrates the intrinsic reparative properties of BMSC-derived EXOs with their unique advantages as nanoscale carriers for miR-17-5p inhibitor delivery, demonstrating therapeutic potential in overcoming the limited intrinsic regenerative capacity of neurons in adult mammals.","Wang Z, Zhang M, Wang F, Wang X, Song X, Wang X, Zhang L, Ren L, Jing X, Yang L",2025,International journal of biological macromolecules,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41232865/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6728,0.9728,YES
41226588,Human Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: A Pioneering Path from Biogenesis to Cerebral Ischemic Stroke Therapy.,"Despite advances in modern medicine and increased public awareness, cerebral stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. With over 600,000 new cases annually, innovative therapeutic strategies are being explored to enhance recovery outcomes. One promising approach is the use of human stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, which function as mediators of intercellular communication. EVs have emerged as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication with immense potential in therapeutic applications. This review discusses the pioneering journey of EVs from their biogenesis and molecular cargo loading to their translation into clinical strategies for cerebral ischemic stroke therapy. While direct stem cell transplantation has faced limitations such as immune rejection, tumorigenicity, and short shelf life, human stem cell-derived EVs offer a cell-free alternative with enhanced safety, stability, and functional versatility. Preclinical studies reveal their capacity to modulate inflammation, protect neural tissue, and promote recovery through the transfer of bioactive molecules. Additionally, EVs isolated from biofluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid serve as promising biomarkers for stroke severity and prognosis. Despite this promise, several challenges persist-from standardizing isolation techniques and optimizing therapeutic cargo to scaling up production for clinical-grade use. This review critically examines the current understanding of EV biology, highlights the advances in stroke-related applications, and outlines key hurdles that must be addressed to unlock their full therapeutic potential.","Roy A, Driscoll T, Grant SC, Li Y",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41226588/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6559,0.8559,YES
41225616,Gingival mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal miR-23a-3p targets IL-6R to attenuate autoimmune insulitis: a cell-free therapeutic strategy for type 1 diabetes.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells, yet current therapies fail to address immune dysregulation. Gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSC) exhibit immunomodulatory potential, but cell-based therapies face challenges in standardization and survival. Exosomes, nanosized vesicles delivering bioactive molecules like miRNAs, offer a cell-free alternative. This study investigates GMSC-derived EXO (GMSC-EXO) enriched with miR-23a-3p as a novel strategy to attenuate T1D progression. Spontaneous T1D in NOD/LtJ mice was treated with GMSC-EXO. Exosome secretion was inhibited using GW4869, and miR-23a-3p was knocked down via LV3-miR-23a-3p inhibitor. Blood glucose, pancreatic inflammation, and immune cell dynamics were monitored in vivo. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (Th1/Th17, Tregs) and cytokine levels were analyzed via flow cytometry and ELISA. Dual-luciferase assays and Western blot validated miR-23a-3p targeting of IL-6R and downstream IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling. GMSC-EXO delayed hyperglycemia progression and improved survival. Depleting exosomes or miR-23a-3p diminished therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, miR-23a-3p directly silenced IL-6R, suppressing IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling, reducing Th1/Th17 infiltration, and expanding Tregs and IL-10 + cells. In vitro, GMSC-EXO reduced IFN-γ/IL-17 A and elevated IL-10, effects abolished by miR-23a-3p inhibition. GMSC-EXO deliver miR-23a-3p to target IL-6R, restoring immune balance and mitigating insulitis in T1D. This study highlights the miR-23a-3p/IL-6R axis as a therapeutic target and establishes GMSC-EXO as a safe, cell-free strategy for autoimmune disorders. These findings provide a foundation for engineering exosome-based therapies in diabetes and related conditions.","Qu Q, Liu SY, Fu B, Ao Q, Long Y, Liu ZY, Wei WM, Hou WJ, Liu XL, Tian XH",2025,Stem cell research & therapy,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41225616/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.471,0.471,YES
41213586,Exosomal Circ_STAT1-AS Delivery Induced by Dexmedetomidine Modulates Microglial Polarization to Alleviate Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy by Inhibiting JAK/STAT1 Pathway.,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, characterized by neuroinflammation. Previous studies have shown that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons can regulate microglial polarization. This study aims to investigate how exosomal circ_STAT1-AS from dexmedetomidine (DEX)-treated DRG neurons affects microglial polarization in DPN. Exosomes were isolated from DRG neurons and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blot. DPN rat model was established by high sugar and fat diet combined with streptozotocin injection. The sciatic nerve conduction velocity, mechanical withdrawal threshold, and thermal withdrawal latency of rats were measured. Hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining of S100B were used to detect spinal cord tissue injury. Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction detected the interaction between histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and unc-13 homolog D (UNC13D) promoter, as well as the H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation level in UNC13D promoter region. Exosomal circ_STAT1-AS secretion from DRG neurons was enhanced by DEX treatment. These exosomes inhibited microglial M1 polarization and facilitated its M2 polarization by suppressing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) translation. Mechanistically, the enhanced exosome secretion was attributed to the increased UNC13D expression, which resulted from HDAC5 inhibition and subsequent elevation of H3K27 acetylation modification at UNC13D promoter under DEX treatment. In DPN rat model, intrathecal administration of circ_STAT1-AS-enriched exosomes alleviated neuropathic symptoms and reduced neuroinflammation. Exosomal circ_STAT1-AS delivery from DRG neurons was enhanced through DEX-mediated HDAC5/UNC13D axis. The increased exosomal circ_STAT1-AS absorbed by microglia suppressed STAT1 translation to inactivate JAK/STAT1 pathway, thereby modulating microglial M1/M2 polarization balance and alleviating DPN.","Wei Y, Zeng X, Li F, Wei S, Li C, Gan Z, Qin Z, Lin Y, Ye M, Wei X",2025,Diabetes & metabolism journal,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41213586/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5058,0.8058,YES

Spinal cord injury presents significant therapeutic challenges. This study investigated the potential synergistic effect of combining Sodium Tanshinone IIA Sulfonate (STS) and bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) for SCI treatment, focusing on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway.The STS-Exo combination significantly protected Mouse Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (bEnd.3) against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, as shown by CCK-8. This synergistic treatment robustly enhanced angiogenic capacity measured through tube formation analysis and accelerated endothelial cell migration in scratch wound healing assays, outperforming individual monotherapies. In SCI rats, combined therapy promoted functional recovery, evidenced by elevated BBB locomotor scores and footprint analysis. Histopathological assessment via HE staining revealed attenuated tissue damage, while Evans Blue extravasation tests confirmed restoration of blood-spinal cord barrier(BSCB) integrity. Furthermore, immunofluorescence quantification showed marked reduction in glial scar formation. Mechanistically, WB and IF analyses confirmed that the STS-Exo combination potently activated the VEGF signaling pathway. This combination strategy represents a promising therapeutic approach for SCI.","Luo D, Ma L, Pan Z, Chen L, Hu Z, Liang C, Wang Z, Xiao Z, Lin D, Li J",2025,Molecular neurobiology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41206417/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6162,0.9162,YES
41204168,Targeted delivery of the GPX4 activator via HUCMSC-derived exosomes inhibits ferroptosis in spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe and multifaceted neurological trauma characterized by neuronal loss, axonal disruption, and limited regenerative potential, often causing lasting neurological deficits. Ferroptosis promotes neural cell death following SCI. The activation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to inhibit ferroptosis is a promising strategy to repair the injured spinal cord. The efficacy of existing treatments is limited due to their inability to penetrate the blood‒spinal cord barrier (BSCB). To address this challenge, we developed a multifunctional delivery system based on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes (MSC-EXOs) targeting the spinal cord. These exosomes were modified with the transactivator of transcription peptide (TAT) and neuron-targeting peptide (RVG) to increase BSCB penetration and SCI-targeting specificity and were also being loaded with the GPX4 activator (GA) to enable ferroptosis inhibition. This multifunctional exosome system has the ability to reduce lipid peroxidation through the activation of GPX4, modulate iron homeostasis, mitigate inflammation, and effectively target the ferroptosis pathway. This targeted approach protects neuronal cells from ferroptosis, promotes axon regeneration and reduce neuroinflammation. This study introduces an innovative, exosome-based strategy to mitigate ferroptosis, underscoring its translational potential for SCI and expanding the possibilities for neuroregeneration.

Cancer-induced depression (CID) can bring more serious medical burden. Exosomes have been implicated in cancer progression and depressive disorders; however, their specific role in CID remains unclear. To investigate the role of exosomes in CID, exosomes derived from 4T1 breast cancer cells were extracted using microfluidic chips-based isolation method. Behavioral assessments were performed to explore the effects of intranasal exosomal myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) on depressive-like behaviors in mice. Additionally, the effects of exosomal MYD88 on neuronal structure and function were researched by Golgi staining, sholl analysis and electrophysiological recordings. Exosomes from 4T1 breast cancer cells induced depressive-like symptoms and altered neuronal structure and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by upregulating MYD88 levels. Conversely, exosomes with reduced MYD88 content did not produce these depressive-like symptoms, suggesting a critical role for MYD88 in the observed effects. Exosomal MYD88 contributes to the development of breast cancer-induced depression. These findings highlight the potential of targeting exosomal pathways, particularly MYD88, as a therapeutic strategy for managing depression in cancer patients.","Zhou B, Ma H, Li Y, He T, Yao X, Liu B, Guo J, Zhang J, Zhang H",2026,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41197687/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5551,0.6551,YES

Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of combination therapy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EXOs with KMP in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model. Forty-five male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. KMP was administered intracerebroventricularly and EXOs were delivered intranasally. Behavioral tests, tissue analyses, and molecular assays measured working memory, cognitive function, motor function, myelin integrity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Behavioral assessments using Y-maze, novel arm discrimination, and wire hang tests revealed that the combination therapy significantly improved working memory, spatial recognition, and motor endurance compared to KMP or EXOs treated groups. Histological analyses demonstrated marked prevention of demyelination, as evidenced by enhanced myelin integrity on FluoroMyelin and Black-Gold II staining. At the molecular level, the combined treatment up regulated the antioxidant genes expression and regulated the activity of key antioxidant enzymes, while simultaneously reducing lipid peroxidation. Glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes expression were also reduced in the EXO + KMP treated mice. These findings suggest that combination therapy with EXOs and KMP improves myelin repair by targeting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in a CPZ-induced demyelination model.","Rabiei F, Askari H, Javan M, Leo G, Lucchi C, Pourbagher R, Biagini G, Ghasemi-Kasman M",2025,Stem cell research & therapy,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41184903/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5566,0.5566,YES

Restoring periodontal homeostasis and promoting periodontal bone repair/regeneration are major challenges for the treatment of diabetic periodontitis. This study introduces antler stem cell-derived exosomes (AnSC-exos) as a potent therapeutic for treating diabetic periodontitis via leveraging the shared cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) origin of antlers and periodontal tissues. Using a rat model of diabetic periodontitis, we demonstrate that AnSC-exos effectively alleviate tissue abnormalities and alveolar bone destruction and resorption in periodontitis under DM conditions; the outcome was significantly more potent than human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hBMSC-exos). Mechanistically, AnSC-exos exhibited dual regenerative actions: (1) restoring the osteogenic ability of resident MSCs by not only reversing high glucose (HG)-induced suppression of proliferation and migration, but more importantly, enhancing cell survival, reducing cell death, and strengthening differentiation toward osteogenic lineages under HG conditions; and (2) attenuating inflammation through potently scavenging excessive ROS production induced by HG, and inhibiting HG-mediated p65 nuclear translocation, thereby leading to a reduced M1/M2 macrophage ratio. In conclusion, the superior efficacy of AnSC-exos highlights their tissue-specific regenerative advantage and establishes AnSC-exos as a promising cell-free therapy that simultaneously targets osteogenic impairment and ROS-driven inflammation in diabetic periodontitis. Further characterization of active components within the exosomes holds significant promise for developing effective clinical treatments for diabetic periodontitis.","Guo Q, Ren S, Libonati A, Li J, Wang Z, Ren J, Zhang G, Gao L, Ba H, Shen Y",2025,Cell death discovery,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41184223/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4953,0.5953,YES
41181109,Smart nanocarriers for cancer: harnessing exosomes and lipid systems in photodynamic and immunotherapy.,"Cancer remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite decades of continuous research, limitations persist in existing therapeutic approaches. Conventional strategies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, though advanced, face challenges including poor bioavailability, toxic side effects, inadequate targeting of cancer cells, and limited survival benefits. The major issue lies in the inability of improved drug formulations to effectively reach cancer cells. Emerging approaches such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immunotherapy have shown greater promise, offering reduced side effects and higher treatment efficiency compared to traditional methods. Various natural and synthetic nanocarriers, including exosomes, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and micelles have been explored as drug delivery vehicles in these therapies. Among them, exosomes, being natural secretory vesicles, have shown unique potential as independent delivery systems. However, challenges and limitations remain in their application for precise cancer targeting. A combinational strategy, integrating exosomes with other lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDS), while preserving their intrinsic properties and engineering their surface to carry photosensitizers (PS) or immune modulators, could overcome these barriers. Such well-designed natural cargos may enhance therapeutic efficacy, modulate the tumor microenvironment, and address current shortcomings in cancer therapy.

Cerebral white matter damage is a primary consequence of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in CP rats. This study aims to explore the potential of massage in facilitating the migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-Exo) to the brain through the chemokine axis, with the goal of moderating cerebral white matter injury in CP rats. Forty-eight rats were randomized to Sham, Model, Massage, and Inhibition groups. HI injury was induced in 3-day-old rat pups and confirmed through righting reflex assessment and cerebral blood flow imaging. The Massage group received daily massage therapy from postnatal day 5 for 28 days. The Inhibition group was treated with a CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100), while the remaining groups were administered saline. Behavioral assessments were conducted at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment. The homing efficiency of BMSCs-Exo was monitored using small animal live imaging, and cerebral oxygen saturation was measured noninvasively through photoacoustic imaging. Neuronal morphology was evaluated using Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence was employed to co-label oligodendrocytes with CXCR4/SDF-1. SDF-1/CXCR4 expression in bone marrow, serum, and brain white matter was assessed using PCR. In vitro experiments involved co-culturing BMSCs with oligodendrocytes under hypoxic and low glucose conditions. The cell groups included Normal control, DMSO control, Massage, and Massage + GW4869 Group. Viability of BMSCs and oligodendrocytes was determined using CCK-8 assays. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize exosomes in oligodendrocytes. HI injury prolonged righting reflex latency and decreased cerebral blood flow. Massage intervention was linked to improved blood flow, increased brain homing of BMSCs-Exo, and enhanced limb function, particularly evident after 4 weeks. Histological analysis using Nissl staining and immunofluorescence demonstrated that massage was coincided with reduced neuronal injury and the upregulation of SDF-1/CXCR4 expression in oligodendrocytes. Initially reduced following HI, SDF-1/CXCR4 levels were restored by massage, with the CXCR4 inhibitor significantly abrogating the therapeutic effects of massage. CCK-8 assays indicated that massage was associated with promoted viability of BMSCs and oligodendrocytes, which was attenuated in the presence of exosome inhibition. Furthermore, the uptake capacity of oligodendrocyte cells for exosomes was superior in the Massage group compared to the DMSO control group. Massage is associated with enhanced motor function and white matter restoration in cerebral palsy, potentially through mechanisms involving the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, increased homing of BMSCs-Exo to the brain, and enhanced oligodendrocyte attachment.","Yiping C, Suyu C, Min L, Yongli L, Yujing Z, Sihan L, Chenggui X, Tinghui Z, Yong L, Ji Z",2025,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41175992/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4674,0.4674,YES

However, their involvement in the pathogenesis of epilepsy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression of alpha B crystallin (CRYAB) in plasma exosomes and the temporal cortex as a potential contributor to epileptogenesis. The study included 112 participants, comprising patients with refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy, glioma patients with and without pre-operative epilepsy, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma exosomes were isolated from peripheral blood using immuno-co-precipitation and resin antibody techniques. Exosome morphology and size distribution were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Neuron- or glia-derived exosomes were enriched through antibody-based immunoabsorption. Plasma CRYAB levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CRYAB expression in neurons and glia of the human temporal cortex was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of CRYAB and inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue. Isolated circulating exosomes were confirmed to be partially derived from the central nervous system (CNS), as evidenced by the presence of neuronal and glial markers. CRYAB was highly expressed in exosomes derived from oligodendrocytes. Patients with epilepsy exhibited significantly elevated levels of plasma oligodendrocyte-derived exosomal CRYAB compared to healthy controls. This was paralleled by increased expression of CRYAB in the temporal cortex of patients with epilepsy, indicating CNS origin of the exosomal cargo. A negative correlation between plasma CRYAB levels and oligodendrocyte-derived exosomal CRYAB was observed in both controls and epileptic patients. Furthermore, patients with epilepsy demonstrated significantly higher density of CRYAB immunoreactivity in temporal cortex oligodendrocytes. The temporal cortex of patients with refractory epilepsy exhibited a significant upregulation of CRYAB, concomitant with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. The finding that plasma oligodendrocyte-derived exosomal CRYAB is upregulated in patients with epilepsy highlights a potential role of oligodendrocyte-secreted CRYAB in its pathogenesis.","Ji X, Wu D, Xie Y, Chen M, Qi Z, Zhou N",2026,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, the conventional methodologies for the purification of EVs from complex biofluids have many limitations, restricting their clinical implementation. We aimed to optimize a direct, less time-consuming, affordable, and reliable nanowire-based method to isolate neuronal EVs from blood plasma. Here, we improved a simple and direct methodology using multiple antibody-coated magnetic nanowires for efficient and rapid isolation of neuronal EVs (ExoAssay) from human plasma. We characterized the isolated EVs and validated the protocol using multiple approaches, for example, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), immunoblotting, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We purified round-shaped EVs with an average size of 116 nm. We identified the general markers of EVs including CD9, CD63, CD81, and Flotillin-1 and two neuronal EV markers L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) via immunoblotting. Interestingly, the levels of T-Tau and P-Tau were upregulated in EVs isolated from Alzheimer's patients (n = 30), in comparison with healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between CSF- and EV-based Tau levels. The high-throughput mass-spectrometry analysis of isolated EVs revealed 280 proteins as significantly modified in Alzheimer's disease cases in comparison with controls. The presented nanotechnology-based methodology offers an innovative and efficient tool for EV-based biomarker investigations and clinical utility by simplifying the enrichment of CNS-originated exosomes from complex biological fluids. This methodology opens up the avenue for longitudinal monitoring of important disease-related proteins in the brain by analysis of brain-derived EVs from blood plasma using simple blood withdrawal.","Fernandez Flores LC, Younas N, Goebel S, Dittmar K, Saleem T, Younas A, Budde H, Legler TJ, Möbius W, Hermann P",2025,Journal of neurochemistry,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41147537/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5322,0.7322,YES
41137812,Photonic Crystal-Enhanced Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Biosensor with an Amphipathic Dendritic Supermolecule Probe for Direct Plasma Exosome Detection.,"Exosomes hold great promise for tumor diagnosis, but their efficient isolation and sensitive in situ detection from biofluids remain challenging. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an ideal solution due to its high sensitivity, yet conventional SERS biosensors face a trade-off between complex nanostructures for strong hotspots and practical fabrication. Here, we developed a novel strategy combining a highly stable large-sized opal photonic crystal (OPC) substrate with an amphipathic dendritic supermolecule probe (ADSP) for exosome capture and detection. The OPC substrate enhances SERS performance by modulating incident light, enabling a simple Au nanolayer to achieve detection limits as low as 1 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M. Meanwhile, ADSP ensures efficient exosome capture from plasma. Together, this approach allows direct isolation and sensitive in situ detection using a structurally simple device. Significant differences between patient and healthy donor groups were observed in practical sample detection, highlighting the potential of this exosome capture and detection platform for clinical applications.","Hu S, Feng X, Liu K, Xie Y, Xu J, Zhou B, Sun L, Liu B, Liu M, Bai X",2025,ACS sensors,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41137812/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4548,0.4548,YES
41122294,Mapping the Landscape of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: From Bench to Bedside.,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine and inflammatory disease management. This bibliometric analysis maps the global research landscape of MSC-derived EV studies from 2014 to 2025, utilizing data from Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and PubMed.

41122173,Neuroinflammation: targeting microglia for neuroprotection and repair after spinal cord injury.,"Neuroinflammation is a tightly regulated process essential for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, debris clearance, and defense against pathogens. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are central to this response, supporting plasticity and repair under normal conditions. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), however, this response becomes amplified and dysregulated. Early microglial activation can be protective, but prolonged activation drives the release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators that exacerbate secondary injury and hinder repair. Microglia also engage in complex crosstalk with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and infiltrating immune cells, orchestrating both protective and damaging processes. This dual and dynamic nature underscores their importance as both targets and modulators in SCI therapies. This review aims to examine the roles of microglia in SCI, summarizes SCI pathology, the specific roles of microglia and macrophages, and outlines translational efforts to modulate their activation, while also highlighting the barriers to clinical application. Evidence from preclinical studies and emerging therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological, cell-based, and exosome-based interventions, demonstrates the potential to reduce harmful inflammation, promote neuroprotection, and support functional recovery. Despite these advances, clinical translation remains limited, constrained by the heterogeneity of microglial responses, narrow therapeutic windows, and patient-specific variability. These challenges often lead to modest or inconsistent clinical outcomes. Future strategies will require precision, multi-targeted approaches that integrate microglial modulation with the preservation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the regulation of peripheral immune infiltration. Harnessing the regenerative potential of microglia, guided by biomarker-based patient stratification and a deeper understanding of their dynamic roles, offers the most promising path toward meaningful recovery after SCI.","Cavalcanti RR, Almeida FM, Martinez AMB, Freria CM",2025,Frontiers in immunology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41122173/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4677,0.7677,YES
41113669,"Exosome engineering for targeted therapy of brain-infecting pathogens: molecular tools, delivery platforms, and translational advances.","Central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by pathogens such as HIV, Herpes simplex virus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Toxoplasma gondii remain among the most difficult to treat due to the physiological barrier posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), pathogen latency, and systemic toxicity associated with conventional therapies. Exosome-based delivery systems are becoming a game-changing platform that can solve these therapeutic problems using their natural biocompatibility, minimal immunogenicity, and capacity to cross the BBB. This review current developments in exosome engineering that aim to make brain-targeted therapy for neuroinfectious illnesses more selective and effective. Much focus is on new molecular methods like pathogen-specific ligand display, aptamer conjugation, lipid modification, and click-chemistry-based surface functionalisation. These methods make it possible to target diseased areas of the brain precisely. Exosomes can also carry therapeutic payloads, such as anti-viral and antifungal drugs, gene editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9 and siRNA, and more. This makes them helpful in changing pathogens' persistence and the host's immunological responses. The paper tackle problems with translation, such as biodistribution, immunogenicity, GMP production, and regulatory issues. Future possibilities like synthetic exosomes, combinatory medicines, and delivery design that uses AI. The combination of nanotechnology, molecular biology, and infectious disease therapies shows that exosome engineering offers a new way to meet the clinical needs that are not satisfied in treating CNS infections.","Onohuean H, Naik Bukke SP, Thalluri C, Abass KS, Choonara YE",2025,Frontiers in medical technology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41113669/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6429,0.8429,YES
41109572,Molecular reflection of the mind: Exosomes in major depressive disorder.,"Exosomes, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by neural and peripheral cells, have become essential mediators in major depressive disorder (MDD). Their diverse cargo, including MicroRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, lipids, and metabolites, impacts key biological processes involved in depression, such as neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and mitochondrial function. Therapeutically, both natural and engineered exosomes are being researched for their ability to deliver neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this review, we carefully analyze current findings, highlighting advantages and drawbacks across different cohorts, and identify common limitations that hinder reproducibility. We also suggest a framework connecting mechanistic insights with biomarker discovery and therapeutic development. Overall, these advances underscore exosomes as versatile tools for precision psychiatry.","Boozarjomehri Amnieh S, Yazdi M, Abrishami M, Keshvari NZ, Saleki K, Rezaei N",2025,Brain research bulletin,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41109572/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5888,0.6888,YES
41106715,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes alleviate neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.,"Spinal cord injury-induced neuropathic pain (SCI-NP), characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms, represents a significant therapeutic challenge. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) have demonstrated potential efficacy in the management of NP, but the mechanism remains to be explored. Here, we aimed to further elucidate the potential analgesic mechanism of BMSC-Exos in SCI-NP. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to identify target genes and associated pathways. We established a SCI-NP model in TLR4<sup>lps-del</sup> and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Paw withdrawal tests were utilized to assess mechanical pain thresholds following SCI. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting analysis were employed to examine microglial activation and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway activity. We subsequently administered BMSC-Exos to the injury site. The analgesic effects and underlying mechanisms were evaluated via previously established methodologies. A comprehensive literature review identified 287 articles on cell therapy for SCI-NP, and the abstracts of these articles were subjected to text mining, leading to the identification of 11 key SCI-NP-related genes and 23 associated pathways, including the TLR4, Toll-like receptor signaling and NF-κB signaling pathways. The SCI-NP model was successfully established. WT mice exhibited increased microglial activation and expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway members. Conversely, in TLR4<sup>lps-del</sup> mice, SCI-NP was suppressed, and the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway members in microglia was decreased. Furthermore, exosome transplantation alleviated SCI-NP, reduced microglial activation, and attenuated TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway expression. BMSC-Exos mitigated SCI-NP by inhibiting microglial activation through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, which is a target for future treatment.","Xu Y, Wang S, Li Z, Wang J, Wang M, Xue Q, Tao J, Huang S, Rastegar-Kashkooli Y, Xu Y",2025,Experimental neurology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41106715/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6455,0.9455,YES
41102301,Safety evaluation of extracellular vesicles derived from hypoxia primed mesenchymal stem cells of umbilical cord and adipose tissue.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise as regenerative therapeutics due to their roles in intercellular communication and tissue repair. This study aimed to assess the safety of EVs derived from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from both umbilical cord (UC-MSC-EVs) and adipose tissue (AD-MSC-EVs) sources, which were manufactured under xeno- and serum-free conditions and primed with 5% O<sub>2</sub>. EVs from neither source caused vascular or muscular stimulation in New Zealand rabbits. Systemic hypersensitivity tests revealed that neither UC-MSC-EVs nor AD-MSC-EVs triggered significant changes in allergic and immune responses or hematological parameters in the animals, highlighting their biocompatibility and safety when administered systemically. Furthermore, acute toxicity test using Swiss mice showed all mice survived without any signs of acute toxicity after intravenous injection of both types of EVs at very high doses (up to 10,000 µg/kg of body weight). In addition, subchronic toxicity examination in Wistar rats revealed that repeated injections of neither UC-MSC-EVs nor AD-MSC-EVs (50-150 µg/animal) affected hematological indices or the functions of the liver, kidney, or spleen. Collectively, our findings provide strong evidence that both UC-MSC-EVs and AD-MSC-EVs manufactured under xeno- and serum-free conditions and primed with 5% O<sub>2</sub> are safe for potential therapeutic use. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the safety of physoxic MSC-derived EVs as therapeutic drugs, confirming their potential for applications in regenerative medicine.","Nguyen QT, Dinh NTH, Hang NT, Van Mao C, Do XH, Le DS, Dao HN, Giang TN, Forsyth N, Hoang VT",2025,Scientific reports,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102301/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4909,0.4909,YES
41096987,Neuronal Differentiation and Exosome Profiling of Dental Pulp Stem Cells: Unveiling Their Potential for Nerve Repair.,"Peripheral nerve injuries remain a major clinical problem, and cell-free therapies using stem cell-derived bioproducts have emerged as promising alternatives. This study evaluated the influence of neurogenic differentiation and passage number on the secretomic and exosomal profile of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPCSs). Conditioned media from undifferentiated and neurodifferentiated hDPSCs, and exosomes derived from undifferentiated hDPSCs at passages 4 and 7, were analyzed using multiplex immunoassays, RT-PCR, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Neurodifferentiated hDPSCs at early passages secreted higher levels of neurotrophic, angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, including FGF-2, IL-6, IL-8, and PDGF-AA. Exosomes from early-passage undifferentiated cells showed a more abundant and relevant neuroregenerative mRNA cargo in comparison to the later passages. Both cell types and exosomes adhered to the Reaxon<sup>®</sup> nerve guidance conduit, confirming the permissive nature of the materials regarding cells and cellular products, allowing adhesion and survival. Neurite outgrowth assays performed on neurodifferentiated hDPSCs confirmed functional neural behavior. In later passages, a decline in secretory and exosomal activity was noted. These results highlight the relevance of early-passage hDPSCs as a source of bioactive factors and support their application in cell-free approaches for peripheral nerve regeneration.","Lopes B, Sousa P, de Sousa Moreira A, Sousa AC, Rêma A, Atayde L, Salgado AJ, Geuna S, Alvites R, Maurício AC",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41096987/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5925,0.6925,YES
41094204,BMSCs-derived exosomal AKAP12 alleviates neuronal cell ferroptosis by inhibiting the STAT3 and ERK signaling pathways in spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a kind of central nervous system damage that causes significant disability. Although bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have been shown to be an effective therapy for SCI, the regulation mechanism of BMSCs in SCI is unclear. The SCI models were established by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment and laminectomy operation. Exosomes were isolated from the supernatant of BMSC cultures via differential ultracentrifugation, followed by characterization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Western blotting. HE and Nissl staining examined pathological changes and neuronal loss in the spinal cord tissues. MTT and PI staining determined cell viability and death. Lipid ROS, iron, GSH, and MDA levels were detected by the C11-BODIPY 581/591 probe and commercial kits. The interactions between p-STAT3 and the TFRC/DMT1 promoter were analyzed by ChIP and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. BMSCs-derived exosomes (BMSCs-exo) suppressed OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis. AKAP12 knockdown weakened the inhibitory impact of BMSCs-exo on OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis. BMSCs-derived exosomal AKAP12 reduced p-ERK and p-STAT3 levels in neuronal cells and p-STAT3 nuclear entry. Additionally, p-STAT3 entering the nucleus increased TFRC and DMT1 promoter transcriptional activity by binding to their promoters. BMSCs-derived exosomal AKAP12 inhibited lipid peroxidation and iron transport signals by inactivating ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways. BMSCs-exo improved the motor function and injury repair in SCI rats by carrying AKAP12. Taken together, BMSCs-derived exosomal AKAP12 inhibited neuronal ferroptosis by repressing TFRC- and DMT1-mediated iron transport signals through inactivating STAT3 and ERK signaling pathways, thereby mitigating SCI. KEY MESSAGES: BMSCs-exo inhibited OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis. AKAP12 silencing in BMSCs weakened the inhibitory impact of BMSCs-exo on OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis. BMSCs-derived exosomal AKAP12 alleviated OGD/R-induced neuronal ferroptosis by inactivating the STAT3 and ERK pathways. Exosomal AKAP12 improved the motor function and injury repair by suppressing the STAT3 and ERK pathways in SCI rats.","Wang F, Pan Z, Zheng H, Zhu Q, Ke C, Zheng F, Hu W",2025,"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41094204/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.6535,0.9535,YES
41088938,Delivery of Nerve Growth Factor via Exosome Attenuates Neuropathic Pain in a Rat Model of Chronic Constriction Injury.,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) is a crucial neurotrophic factor with the ability to induce neuronal differentiation. However, whether NGF-loaded exosomes (Exo-NGF) can alleviate neuropathic pain in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats remains unclear. A neuropathic pain model was established using CCI rats. The pain was assessed using the von Frey test and the hot plate test. Exo-NGF was collected from HEK293 cells transfected with an NGF plasmid. The diameter of Exo-NGF was determined using transmission electron microscopy. Protein levels of inflammatory factors, including IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α, were measured using enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay, and their mRNA levels were evaluated using qPCR. The NODlike receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) protein levels were determined using immunostaining and Western blot. NGF protein and mRNA were highly expressed in Exo-NGF. The mRNA in Exo-NGF was successfully delivered into neural stem cells and promoted their differentiation. Injection of Exo- NGF into the spinal dorsal horn significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Additionally, Exo-NGF reduced levels of IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α. NLRP3 and its key components, including apoptosis-associated speck-like protein and caspase-1, were also reduced by Exo- NGF treatment in CCI rats. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of exosome-based NGF delivery for treating chronic pain conditions. Exo-NGF significantly alleviates neuropathic pain by suppressing inflammation and NLRP3 activation.","Li Y, Chen C, Su C, Li S, Wen Z, Zheng Y",2025,Current neuropharmacology,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41088938/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.5625,0.7625,YES

While next-generation PLD1 inhibitors have failed in preclinical mammalian models due to poor CNS penetration, we revisit our functionally proven inhibitor VU0155069 (or VU01), demonstrating a definitive solution to this delivery challenge. We engineered an exosome/extracellular vesicle (EVs)-based nanocarrier (Exo-VU01) to encapsulate VU0155069, optimizing drug payload via electroporation and confirming vesicle integrity through Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. The therapeutic potential of this formulation was tested in a head-to-head intravenous pharmacokinetic study against free VU0155069 in mice. Relative to free VU0155069, which exhibited rapid systemic clearance and negligible brain retention, Exo-VU01 achieved approximately 20-fold higher brain area under the curve (AUC), underscoring its potential to optimize drug retention and regional biodistribution within the CNS. Our study validates Exo-VU01 as a viable platform for CNS drug delivery. It provides increased efficacy for VU0155069 as a therapeutic candidate for AD/ADRD and establishes a clear translational pathway for targeted delivery.","Budhwani S, Sreenivasamurthy SGS, Garza KH, Flores-Espinosa P, Menon R, Kammala AK, Krishnan B",2025,Pharmaceutical research,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41087673/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.597,0.697,YES
41079604,Bee venom promotes exosome secretion and alters miRNA cargo in T cells.,"Exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication, primarily through the transfer of miRNAs. However, the mechanisms regulating exosome secretion and miRNA cargo loading in T cells remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of bee venom (BV), a natural compound with known immunomodulatory activity, on the exosomal miRNA profile in human Jurkat T cells. The non-cytotoxic concentration of BV (2 μg/mL) was identified using the CCK-8 assay. Exosomes were isolated from BV-treated and control cells and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), with NTA also used to quantify particle concentration for assessing changes in secretion levels. High-throughput sequencing identified 74 differentially expressed miRNAs (44 upregulated, 30 downregulated), which were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Functional enrichment analyses (gene ontology, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, disease ontology, Reactome) revealed associations with pathways related to neural development, cell cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis. BV treatment significantly promoted exosome release and selectively altered miRNA cargo. These findings suggest that BV modulates T cell-derived exosome output and composition, providing mechanistic insights into how it may influence immune-related signaling pathways.","Cui Z, Zhou Z, Sun Z, Duan J, Liu R, Qi C, Yan C",2025,Open life sciences,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41079604/,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4607,0.5607,YES

Due to the trend of global population aging, the incidence of spinal cord injury is increasing year by year. It is imperative to study new treatment strategies for spinal cord injury. We successfully isolated exosomes from dental pulp stem cells and detected their ability to promote axonal growth through the PC12 cell model. Subsequently, we used a mouse animal model of SCI to analyze its effects on the neurological function, motor ability, neuroinflammation, nerve apoptosis and axonal regeneration. The results showed that DPSC-Exos promoted axonal growth, inhibited nerve apoptosis, suppressed the proliferation of glial cells and the secretion of inflammatory factors, and significantly improved the neurological dysfunction and motor ability of mice. Our results indicate that DPSC-Exos exerts neuroprotective effects and promotes axonal repair by inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis, thereby positioning it as a promising therapeutic candidate for SCI.","Li F, Liao X, Huang Y, Zhou H, Nie X",2026,Tissue & cell,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41076940/,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.634,0.934,YES
