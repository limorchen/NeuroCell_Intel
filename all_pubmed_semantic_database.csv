41452255,Potential of exosomes for targeted therapy in neuroinfectious disease management: crossing the blood-brain barrier.,"Neuroinfectious diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis continue to be a significant health issue especially in low- and middle-income nations where the timely identification and successful treatment are mostly not yet available. There is also the complicating factor of the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which greatly limits the passage of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents through into the central nervous system. Exosomes which are nano-sized extracellular vesicles released by a vast variety of cells have been proposed as a promising solution to overcome this barrier because of their natural biocompatibility, low immunogenicity and capacity to enter the BBB by receptor-mediated, adsorptive-mediated and carrier-mediated processes. This review critically discusses the structural and functional dynamics of the BBB in infection, the recent discoveries in the exosome trafficking pathways, and the diagnostic and therapeutic role of exosomes in infection, including infections related to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, neurotoxoplasmosis. Special consideration will be given to engineered exosomes and how they could be used to improve targeted delivery of drugs, decrease systemic toxicity and offer minimally invasive biomarkers platforms to detect disease earlier. He/she points possible solutions to CNS infections by combining mechanistic understanding with newly acquired pre-clinical and clinical results, this review emphasizes the increasing promise of exosome-based nanomedicine as a transformational technology.","Bukke SPN, Yadav S, Prajapati S, Shobha Rani S, Reddy MS, Thalluri C, Chettupalli AK, Goruntla N, Pradeepkumar B, Eftekhari Z",2025,Tissue barriers,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41452255/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.6919,0.8919,YES

41443186,Biomarkers.,"Exosomes from brain cells, such as neuron-derived (NDEs) and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs), can cross the blood-brain barrier and be detected in peripheral circulation. These vesicles facilitate communication between the central nervous system (CNS), neuroendocrine, and immune systems, carrying miRNAs and proteins that are protected from degradation. While exosomes are well-studied in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), their role in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Late-Life Depression (LLD)-which may be prodromal stages of dementia-remains unclear. This project aims to identify biosignatures in NDEs, ADEs, and plasma to explore molecular profiles shared by LLD, MCI, and AD. We recruited 40 LLD subjects, 25 with MCI, 24 with AD, and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. After psychiatric evaluation, blood samples were collected, centrifuged to obtain platelet-free plasma, and stored at -80°C. Total exosomes were isolated using size exclusion chromatography and analyzed via NanoSight Pro nanotracking. NDEs and ADEs were quantified using the vFC™ vesicle flow cytometry kit on a CytoFlex system, while protein cargo was analyzed with Quanterix, SMCpro, and LX200. Five neuropsychiatric-associated miRNAs were assessed: miR-100-5p, miR-l-3p, miR-184, miR-221-3p, miR-766, and miR-5680. LLD and MCI showed no differences in NDEs and ADEs compared to controls, while AD had elevated levels. No microRNA differences were found between LLD and controls, but five of six miRNAs were reduced in AD. Proteomic analysis revealed persistent neuroinflammation in AD compared to LLD and MCI. These findings suggest compromised brain-periphery communication in MCI, LLD, and AD, highlighting exosomes as a window into the molecular pathology of these disorders.","Vieira E, Nikolova Y, Elmi S, Mendes-Silva AP, Kumar S, Diniz BS, Rajji TK",2025,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41443186/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.6001,0.8001,YES
41438685,CircRNAs: Novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diseases of the central nervous system.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of covalently closed, non-coding RNA molecules characterized by their exceptional stability and tissue-specific expression. Once considered splicing artifacts, they have emerged as pivotal regulators in cellular pathophysiology, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS), where they are highly abundant. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the biogenesis, molecular functions, and regulatory roles of circRNAs in major CNS disorders, underscores their significant potential as next-generation diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as promising therapeutic targets. Moving from bench to bedside, the review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of circRNA-based therapeutics. We assess the promise and limitations of current delivery platforms, including exosomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with special attention to the formidable challenge of traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To conclude, we outline the prevailing challenges and future perspectives, emphasizing that the development of more sensitive detection methods and optimized delivery systems is paramount to translating the immense potential of circRNAs into tangible clinical solutions for CNS diseases.","Cui J, Shen L, Han B",2026,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41438685/,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.5389,0.7389,YES
41431712,Human umbilical cord plasma derived exosome inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and neuro-apoptosis in traumatic spinal cord injury model.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes severe functional impairments and involves both primary mechanical damage and secondary inflammation. Exosomes from human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) are emerging as promising therapies due to their bioactive components that regulate inflammation and support repair. Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A (laminectomy), Group B (contusion), Group C (contusion + PBS), and Group D (contusion + HUCB-exosomes). Contusion injuries were induced using the New York University (NYU) impactor method. HUCB-derived exosomes were extracted and confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface markers CD81 and CD9 via flowcytometry, along with dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential analysis. HUCB-exosomes were administered without prior in vitro expansion; 30 minutes' post-injury, Group D received 100 µg of HUCB-exosomes via tail vein injection for one week. Motor and behavioral functions were assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale, narrow beam test (NBT), rotarod test, and open-field test. Western blotting was performed eight weeks' post-injury to analyze changes in inflammatory cytokines, and histological changes were assessed via H&E staining. HUCB-exosome administration significantly enhanced functional recovery in SCI rats, as evidenced by higher BBB scores, improved narrow beam, rotarod, and open-field performances compared with PBS and contusion groups. Histological analysis showed reduced cavity formation, increased neuronal density, and decreased gliosis in the exosome-treated group. Western blot results revealed marked downregulation of TNF-α, NLRP3, and GFAP expression. Additionally, exosome therapy restored antioxidant balance by reducing ROS and GSSG levels while elevating GSH, and immunohistochemistry confirmed reduced expression of apoptotic and autophagy markers. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of HUCB-derived exosomes in SCI, demonstrating their ability to attenuate inflammation and promote functional recovery. These findings support HUCB-exosomes as a promising, non-cell-based treatment strategy for SCI.","Taheri H, Mosleh HR, Darabi L, Jahanbaz S, Mirni HK, Farahani RM, Aliaghaei A, Nazarian H, Bahar R, Hasanzadeh M",2026,3 Biotech,N/A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41431712/,1,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.7624,1.0624,YES
41424243,Collagen-Based Hydrogel Loaded With Microspheres Encapsulated With Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes Synergistically Promote Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is a serious medical issue where there is a loss of sensorimotor function. Current interventions continue to lack the ability to successfully enhance these conditions; therefore, it is crucial to consider alternative effective strategies. Currently, we investigated the effects of collagen-based hydrogel (CbH) loaded with microspheres encapsulated with placental mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs)-derived exosomes in the recovery of TSCI in rats. Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 15/group): TSCI (injury without treatment), CbH, Microsphere (exosomes encapsulated in microspheres), and CbH + Microsphere. At 48 h, 10 rats per group were sacrificed for immunohistochemical (caspase-3), molecular (cytokines), and biochemical (oxidative stress markers) analyses; the remaining five rats per group were used for stereological evaluations at day 14. Furthermore, behavioral assessment was performed pre-injury and on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post-injuries. Results showed that the CbH + Microsphere group exhibited significantly reduced lesion volume and apoptosis, improved neuron preservation, and increased total volume compared to the TSCI group. Additionally, this group had higher levels of antioxidant enzymes (GSH, SOD, CAT) and IL-10, and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and MDA. Functional recovery, as reflected by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores, was significantly better in the CbH + Microsphere group across all time points post-injury. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CbH encapsulated with microspheres containing PMSCs-derived exosomes could enhance the prevention of injury spreading and the enhancement of pathological and behavioral symptoms when delivered to the location of spinal cord injury.","Zou J, Razali MH, Sun Z, Gao Y",2026,"Journal of biomedical materials research.
