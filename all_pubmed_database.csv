40911028,Cutting-edge strategies for delivering drugs to the brain based on nanocarriers.,"This review aims to explore advanced nanotechnology-integrated delivery systems designed to facilitate the transport of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, particularly neurodegenerative diseases. CNS disorders remain a primary global health concern due to their progressive nature and limited treatment options. Conventional therapies exhibit minimal efficacy, primarily due to the restrictive nature of the BBB, which impedes drug access to brain tissue. Overcoming this barrier is crucial to improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing systemic side effects. A comprehensive analysis of nanotechnology-based approaches was conducted, focusing on the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers, their interactions with the BBB, and their roles in targeted drug delivery. Strategies involving nanoparticle engineering, ligand-functionalized systems, and gene delivery vectors were critically reviewed. Nanotechnology has shown considerable promise in facilitating drug delivery across the BBB. Nano-engineered platforms are capable of targeting specific cells, modulating signaling pathways, enhancing neuronal survival, and even inducing regeneration. Various successful nanocarriers, including liposomes, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles, and exosomes, demonstrate enhanced drug penetration and specificity. Nanotechnology holds transformative potential in treating CNS disorders by addressing the limitations posed by the BBB. Continued research into the design and optimization of brain-targeted nano-systems holds the key to safer, more effective therapies. The manuscript also highlights current challenges and considerations in developing such delivery systems for clinical application.","Shaw TK, Shuvo SM, Paul P, Jana A, Ali KA",2025-Sep-15,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,N/A,N/A,N/A,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40911028/,0,004495e4da4502549f7dd22e1654bc33,2025-09-16 10:24:07
40721664,Therapeutic potential of plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles for CNS diseases: advancements in preparation and characterization.,"<b>Background:</b> Central nervous system (CNS) diseases pose significant therapeutic challenges owing to their complex pathophysiology and the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). <b>Introduction:</b> Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PDELNs) exhibit intrinsic bioactivity, low immunogenicity, and ability to cross the BBB, making them a promising therapeutic strategy for CNS disorders. <b>Discussion:</b> This review explores the preparation, isolation, and characterization of PDELNs, with a focus on their therapeutic applications in CNS diseases. We also discuss different administration routes and the impact of functional modifications on BBB penetration. <b>Conclusions:</b> PDELNs offer scalability, biocompatibility, and natural pharmacological activity, which make them attractive candidates for CNS drug delivery. However, challenges remain, including standardized isolation, elucidation of BBB penetration mechanisms, and long-term stability and safety. Future research should focus on clarifying their mechanisms of action, optimizing preparation methods, and validating their long-term safety to facilitate the clinical translation of PDELNs. KEY MESSAGESPDELNs are derived from abundant plant sources, exhibit favorable physicochemical properties.PDELNs offer new possibilities for CNS therapies owing to their low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility, and ability to cross the BBB.","Liu M, Wang H, Yang Y, Wang J, Sun Z, Zhao S, Kong W, Sun W, Wang C, Feng L",2025-Dec,Annals of medicine,57,1,N/A,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40721664/,0,e997cf781a29d4f110b2144549059592,2025-09-16 10:24:07
40580685,Multifaceted roles of extracellular vesicles in the interplay of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Despite advances in understanding neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, effective treatments remain elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), key mediators of intercellular communication within the central nervous system (CNS), are increasingly recognized for their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD). In vivo studies demonstrate EVs' crucial role in maintaining CNS homeostasis, modulating neuroinflammatory responses, and influencing tissue repair and regeneration following injury, thereby impacting disease progression and recovery. Their unique properties, including small size and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), position them as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutics in CNS diseases. This review delves into the significant impact of neuroinflammation on neurodegenerative conditions, specifically focusing on the multifaceted contributions of EVs and their intricate interplay with the inflammatory landscape. We explore EV biogenesis, cargo composition, diverse roles in neuroinflammation (including intercellular communication and neuroprotection), their potential as biomarkers and drug delivery vehicles across the BBB for diagnosis or treatment of neuroinflammation implemented neurodegenerative diseases.","Deng Z, Chen H, Chen J, Du Z, Zhou W, Yuan Z",2025-Oct,Biochimica et biophysica acta.
