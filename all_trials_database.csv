NCT04121065,Role of ADA SNPs in Subjects With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS),"The therapeutic landscape for multiple sclerosis (MS) is rapidly evolving. For the past 25 years, there has been an accelerating inclusion of new immunomodulating drugs. MS immunotherapies may also be classified in a different way, into treatments that are given continuously (chronic treatments) and medications that are applied intermittently (immune reconstitution therapies \[IRTs\]). The principle behind the latter is depletion of the immune system that allows it to rebuild itself. An IRT by definition is given at short intermittent courses and not continuously. IRT modalities were shown to induce long-term remission of MS that, in some cases, is close to the definition of a ""cure"".

Most importantly, IRT using these modalities causes substantial changes in the lymphocyte repertoire after the reconstitution phase.

This is particularly true for Cladribine (2-CdA), a high efficacy therapy that selectively depletes peripheral lymphocytes, recently approved by the European Medicine Agencies for RMS patients with high activity of disease.

Lymphocytes have a high intracellular ratio of DCK to 5'-NTs compared with other cell types. Specifically, levels of DCK and the ratio of DCK to 5'-NT are high in T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), B cells, and dendritic cells but are very low in numerous non-hematologic cell types (http://biogps.gnf.org). This makes lymphocytes, mainly memory B cells, particularly sensitive to the accumulation of 2-CdA nucleotides. The intracellular accumulation of 2-CdATP leads to the incorporation of 2-CdATP into cellular DNA, disrupting the double helix structure and leading to a failure of DNA repair and synthesis. The resulting DNA strand breaks alter the cell cycle progression inducing cell death mediated by apoptosis. Although apoptosis is the most prominent mechanism of action of 2-CdA, additional mechanisms cannot be excluded. Many evidences shown that nucleotide signaling governs some of the most essential responses in immunity, ranging from antigen-driven T lymphocyte proliferation to T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell differentiation, from neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis to intracellular pathogen killing, and from NADPH-oxidase activation to IL-1β maturation and release. In addition, an analysis of lymphocytes subsets collected in the pivotal phase III trial of Cladribine showed that while T cells reduction shows some Cladribine-dose dependency, B cells have a similar reduction with both dosing schedules in the trial. Moreover, the mean number of T and B cells do not differ between patients remaining free from relapses and patients developing relapses, suggesting that efficacy of Cladribine is not strictly dependent on reduction of lymphocyte count. On the other hand, a lower lymphocyte count has been correlated with a higher risk of developing an Herpes Zoster infection, with all the events restricted and dermatomal, and most of them graded as mild or moderate. Thus, severe lymphopenia is also an important identified risk for safety. In phase III clinical trials (RCTs), 20-25% of the subjects treated with 3.5mg/kg of oral 2-CdA developed transient Grade 3-4 lymphopenia. The rate of patients who discontinued the treatment for lymphopenia was highest (12.4%) in the group that received the greatest cumulative dose of 2-CdA (CC 8.75 mg/kg) at the end of the extension phase of the CLARITY study (22). This effect has been also correlated in others disease with a reduced level of DCK mRNA and a higher level of 5'NT mRNA in lymphocytes. Though the biological activation of 2-CdA needs DCK function independently of ADA action, it cannot be excluded ADA participation in other aspects of 2-CdA mechanism of action, taking in consideration ADA crucial role in lymphocytes activation and function.

In line with this, it has been recently identified an ADA genetic variant (rs244072, non-risk/risk allele: T/C) linked to brain inflammation and MS disease severity (article in preparation), by screening more than 50 SNPs in MS-related genes of 514 MS patients and looking for association with clinical and biochemical parameters. The most striking result observed was a direct correlation between the presence of at least one risk allele and EDSS score, namely CT/CC patients show higher values of EDSS than TT patients (p=0.016).

Therefore, we hypothesize that the genetic polymorphism of ADA gene, found to correlate with MS disease severity, can also influence the 2-CdA response in term of drug sensitivity/resistance as well as side effects, like lymphocytopenia. According to the rationale, in the panorama of the current therapeutic options available to the patient MRS, Cladribine is the only immune-reconstitution therapy to have an action mechanism that interferes with that of the ADA and for this it has been selected the Cladribine as a reference treatment in clinical practice for this study.

Subjects candidate to be treated with Cladribine according to clinical practice and meeting the SmPc requirements during a pre-baseline screening period of up to -3 months before baseline (month 0), will receive an initial treatment course in week 1 and week 5 (W1-W5) as per clinical practice.

Subjects will attend visits for blood sample as per mandatory monitoring before initiating Cladribine in year 1, before initiating Cladribine in year 2, and 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment year.

The study will last 2 years for each subjects, providing five visits: screening, at month 0, at month 6, at month 12 and at month 24, according to clinical practice for MS subjects monitoring.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the influence of the ADA SNP rs244072 (non-risk/risk allele: T/C) on lymphopenia induced by Cladribine (2-CdA) in real world setting in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).

The secondary objectives are:

* To evaluate molecular, metabolic and immunological factors involved in the mode of action of Cladribine, that can influence patients' response to treatment, focusing in particular on lymphopenia;
* To collect safety and tolerability data on RMS patients treated with Cladribine;
* To assess the effect of Cladribine on progression of disability and incidence of relapses.

The study will include the collection of blood samples to investigate the primary and secondary endpoints. For these analyses, a maximum of 60 ml of blood will be collected at month 0, month 6, month 12 and month 24.

Quantitative variables will be reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and Interquartile Range (Q1-Q3), Categorical variables will be reported as number (n) and percentage (%) Primary endpoints and clinical endpoints will be evaluated on all sample. Others secondary endpoint will evaluate on patients of each center unless otherwise indicated.

T Student test or Mann Whitney test will be used to compare baseline characteristics of two groups (associated with the genetic polymorphism of ADA), Chi square test o Fisher exact test when necessary, will be used for categorical variables. Shapiro Wilk test and graphics methods will be use to assess normality assumptions.

In primary endpoint analysis paired t test will be used to evaluate change in lymphocytes in each group separately. Linear mixed model will be used to compare change in two groups taking in account repetitive data for each patient (patient as random effect) group, time and group per time as fixed effects. Model assumptions will be checked, in case of they are not support logarithm data or other models will be used.

Different mixed models will be used to evaluate clinical endpoint on all sample during time.

NCT07077616,Clinical Study for the Safety and Therapeutic Efficacy of the AI-QMMM Designed TamavaqTM Personalised Vaccine in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioma.,"Quantum Vaccinomics for the Generation of the TAMAVAQ personalized neoantigenic vaccines.

The personalized neoantigen vaccines will be prepared based on the analysis of whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq data generated from fresh-frozen tumours or tumours that will be available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, obtained at the time of diagnostic resection. WES of normal tissue will be generated from autologous PBMC DNA. Patient HLA allotype will be assessed using standard class I and class II PCR-based typing (BWH Tissue Typing Laboratory). Coding mutations will be identified and personal neoantigens will be predicted based on binding affinity analysis to individual HLA alleles using class I MHC binding prediction tools with a cut-off of predicted IC50 \< 500 nM for selected epitopes. Quantum Circuit platforms for the identification of immunological quantum and design of TAMAVAQ's NeoVaccine consisted of Druggable Immunodominant and Immunogenic Neo-epitopic Peptides will be incorporated in this clinical study. Candidate and Prioritized Neo-epitopic Peptides are identified using systems biology integration of omics dataset combined with Big Data analytics and machine learning. Then, the immunodominant quantized peptide will be identified by using in silico algorithms and HLA epitope mapping and binding domains involved in each one Glioma Patient's Drug-DNA-Protein-protein interactions.

This clinical trial provides an AI-QMMM method for the identification and characterization of neoantigens and outlines the clinical applications of prospective immunotherapeutic strategies based on neoantigens exploring their current status, inherent challenges, and clinical translation potential against Glioma medical conditions.

Enhanced Targeted Therapy\*\*:- The TAMAVAQ vaccine specifically targets neoantigens unique to glioma cells, potentially leading to a more effective immune response while sparing healthy cells. This specificity may reduce collateral damage associated with traditional cancer therapies.

Immune System Activation\*\*:The TAMAVAQ personalized vaccine is designed to stimulate the patient's immune system, enhancing its ability to recognize and attack glioma cells. This activation can lead to a more robust and sustained anti-tumor response.

Potential for Long-term Remission\*\*:- By training the immune system to identify and remember glioma cells, patients may achieve longer-lasting remission rates and a reduced likelihood of tumor recurrence compared to conventional therapies.\*\*Reduction in Side Effects\*\*:- Compared to traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, which often come with significant side effects, the TAMAVAQ personalized neoantigen vaccine may result in fewer adverse effects, thereby improving the patient's quality of life.

Personalized Treatment Approach\*\*:- Each TAMAVAQ vaccine is tailored to the individual patient's tumor profile, potentially increasing the efficacy of the treatment. This personalization allows for a more precise approach to therapy that aligns with the unique characteristics of each Glioma patient's cancer.

Opportunities for Combination Therapies\*\*:- The TAMAVAQ vaccine can potentially be used in conjunction with other treatments (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies), enhancing overall treatment effectiveness and providing a multifaceted approach to combat glioma.\*\*Real-time Monitoring and Adaptation\*\*:- This clinical trial setting allows for continuous monitoring of patient responses, providing valuable data that can lead to adaptations in treatment strategies based on observed efficacy and safety profiles.

This TAMAVAQ clinical trial holds substantial potential benefits, ranging from enhanced targeted therapy and immune activation to improved patient quality of life and contributions to scientific knowledge. As research progresses, it is essential to continue evaluating these benefits in conjunction with the associated risks to optimize treatment strategies for glioma patients.The development of the TAMAVAQ personalized vaccine represents a novel approach to glioma treatment. This analysis evaluates the potential risks and benefits associated with conducting a clinical trial for this innovative therapeutic strategy.

This clinical trial aims to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a personalized neoantigenic vaccine designed for patients diagnosed with glioma. The TAMAVAQ study will involve identifying patient-specific neoantigens from tumor biopsies and formulating tailored vaccines to stimulate an immune response against glioma cells. Following surgery, patients will receive conventional radiation therapy administered at 180-200 cGy per fraction daily for five days per week to a total of approximately 60 Gy. Personalized neoantigen vaccines TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine will be prepared using information from fresh tumour and normal tissue obtained at the time of diagnostic resection, as described below. Algorithms and methods based on profiles of sequence motifs, quantitative matrices (QM), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR), T-cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding prediction and molecular docking simulations among others will be combined and used in order to predict and design the TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine-Drug Product Neo-epitopes. Quantum chemical calculations (IBM Quantum Studio) will be used to predict the TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine-Drug Product's biological function and be applied to T-cell receptor interaction with TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine-Drug Product Peptide/MHC class I. A cluster of algorithms is proposed here using semi-empirical quantum mechanical methods for calculating peptide-MHC class I and II molecules binding energy for the rational design of T-cell TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine-Drug Product Neo-epitopes with application in cancer glioma vaccinology. The vaccine will be administered subcutaneously at least seven to twelve weeks following completion of external beam radiotherapy. TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine-Drug Product will be applied before maintenance of TMZ cycles after completion of chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Beginning on day 14 before the first maintenance TMZ cycle, patients will receive 7 vaccinations with TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine drug products during 7 weeks. 20-200 μg per peptide per vial are used followed by two booster doses eight and sixteen weeks later. For each dose, vaccine will be administered within six hours of thawing in a non-rotating fashion to one of up to four extremities. Patients will be repeatedly vaccinated with TAMAVAQ NeoVaccine drug products beginning on day 33 of the 6 maintenance TMZ cycle. Patients will receive 9 vaccinations within 12 weeks. 20-400 μg per peptide per vial will be used. Concomitant medications deemed necessary for adequate patient care will be allowed, including concomitant corticosteroids for symptoms associated with cerebral oedema, but the study vaccine will be held for patients requiring more than 4 mg per day of dexamethasone within seven days of vaccine administration. Clinical assessment and monitoring will be delivered by using the RANO criteria and the Immunotherapy Response Assessment in the Neuro-Oncology criteria.

Patients will be recruited preoperatively who underwent lower extremity joint replacement. The following tests will be performed: 1) genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural variation, with a particular focus on the following genes: COMT, BDNF, SCN11a, OPRM1, ACBC1, CYPD26, CYP34A, ANKK1, OPRD1, OPRK1,NGFB, UGT2B7, FFAR2, FFAR3, GABRG2, SLCO1B1, DRD4; 2) longitudinal gut microbiome sampling; and 3) exosome profiling - blood will be collecting for RNAseq and plasma for metabolomics and extracellular vesicle characterization with ultimate impact on in vitro cell function. These genes were selected because they have been shown to be associated with opioid use, opioid metabolism, and pain. Furthermore, subjects will fill out surveys preoperatively, including: pain catastrophizing scale, brief pain inventory, PROMIS-29, and fibromyalgia survey criteria. Other data collected will include body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, lifestyle habits, and medication use.

The hypothesis is that there will be clinically significant associations with patient genetics, microbiome, exosome profiles with their postoperative opioid use. Such findings will help personalize pain interventions for high-risk patients undergoing knee or hip arthroplasty in order to help improve postoperative pain control and reduce incidence of chronic opioid use.

Visit 1 can be combined with a routine clinic visit for care or research but also may be done remotely via Zoom. During visit 1, the investigators will fully explain the study and obtain the participant\&#39;s informed consent. For remote visits, a copy of the consent will be emailed to the participant before the visit and the study team will schedule a time to discuss the consent. The informed consent will be reviewed in detail with the participant, and they will have an opportunity to ask any questions before signing the document and agreeing to the study. In either case, once the participant agrees to the study after being fully informed, they will sign the consent document and a copy of it will be provided to them after the investigator signs it.

Once informed consent has been obtained, the participant will either schedule visit 1 or begin visit 1 that day. Visit 1 will last no more than 2 hours and will involve the collection of clinical data and the collection of a blood sample. The participant will be asked to obtain lab work before visit 2, these labs will be to test the participant\&#39;s blood for its ability to clot well. This lab work will be reviewed before visit 2. Visit 2 will take no more than 4 hours and will involve the collection of spinal fluid. The participant will need to be accompanied by a driver at visit 2.

Description of Study Procedures

Blood Work prior to scheduled visit (\~30 minutes)

• will need to go to one of the University of Florida Health's (UF Health\&#39;s) local labs in Gainesville, Florida (FL) to have blood work done before the scheduled visit 2. This blood work will ensure that the participant meet the inclusion criteria before the spinal tap.

Overall health and safety assessment (\~30 minutes)

* The participant\&#39;s birthdate, gender, contact information, health history, current medications, and allergies will be obtained. The information will be stored in the participant\&#39;s study file.
* If the participant is a woman of childbearing potential, a urine sample will be tested to see if they are pregnant. If the test is positive, the participant will not be able to continue in the study.
* The participant\&#39;s FRDA DNA test from their medical record will be assessed and a copy placed in the research folder. No additional genetic testing will be performed.
* Measurements such as the participant\&#39;s height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature will be obtained.
* A general physical examination will be done by the study physician

Neurological examination, modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS), and blood sample (\~30 minutes)

* The study physician will perform a neurological examination and use this to rate the participant\&#39;s ataxia severity in the mFARS scale.
* This will include examining the participant\&#39;s eye movements, speech, strength of their muscles, sensation, coordination in their arms and legs and ability to stand and walk among other things.
* The participant will be asked questions regarding their activities of daily living for a questionnaire called FRDA activities of daily living scale (FARS ADL).
* A blood sample of approximately 5-10 milliliters (or 1-2 teaspoonfuls) will be obtained.

Spinal Tap (\~3 hours)

* About 15 milliliters or 1 tablespoon of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected though a test called a spinal tap.
* The spinal tap will be performed in the interventional radiology suite at the Neuromuscular hospital via x-ray fluoroscopy.

NCT04202783,The Use of Exosomes In Craniofacial Neuralgia,"The present study is designed to amplify the delivery of growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes are thought to play a normal physiological role in intercellular signaling, and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports. Clinical trials have deployed exosomes intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection, and have claimed safety and clinical efficacy.

Focused ultrasound has been shown to enhance local blood flow and has been presented as a non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents.",Neuralgia,Exosomes,NA,INTERVENTIONAL,SUSPENDED,2023-12-01,2024-12-01,Neurological Associates of West Los Angeles,100,18 Years - N/A,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04202783,0,3c11a6d2f08fc95054e01a1f55e7511e,2025-09-16 10:24:08

NCT04184076,Randomized Controlled Trial of Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,"Specific Aims This project is to conduct a pilot, phase II randomized clinical trial which aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) The primary endpoint is the safety and compliance of 4 weeks of TRF in AIS patients.

The secondary endpoints are the efficacy of 4 weeks of TRF compared to normal eating (NE) on plasma and imaging biomarkers and functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.

This study will determine whether compared to NE control:

1. TRF (16 hours fasting daily) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with AIS.
2. TRF improves functional outcome compared to NE in AIS patients. (3) TRF decreases plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines including metallopeptidase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in plasma compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.

(4) TRF improves diffusion tensor imaging on MRI at 3 months post stroke compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.

(5) TRF changes plasma exosome components, metabolomics and lipidomics compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.",Fasting,Time-restricted feeding (TRF) with dietary counseling,NA,INTERVENTIONAL,UNKNOWN,2020-01-01,2022-12-31,National Taiwan University Hospital,40,20 Years - 80 Years,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04184076,0,c1390f0a5e35c3b410494f36b3268677,2025-09-16 10:24:08
NCT04714892,Mechanisms Underlying Individual Variations of Taste and Smell in Obesity,"Study Description:

This study involves comparison of taste and smell measures between obese and non-obese individuals. Taste and smell perceptions will be assessed in terms of their influence in food intake and food choices. We hypothesize that obesity negatively affects taste and smell perception thus affecting eating behavior.

Objectives:

Obesity is a major public health concern in America. An unhealthy diet is a recognized risk factor for the development of obesity. Public health efforts to modify eating behaviors have had limited success. Not only does an unhealthy diet contribute to obesity, but it can also lead to changes in gut microbiota that likely result in inflammation and changes in transcriptomic activity. Taste and smell perceptions, which can influence food choices and food consumption, may differ between obese and non-obese individuals. Currently, little is known about the underlying mechanisms causing variations in taste and smell systems in individuals with obesity, which limits the interventions currently available to address this critical issue. Findings from this study can be used to design more effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity, to identify targets and strategies for countermeasures to prevent or improve obesity and its comorbidities, and to suggest ways to enhance dietary interventions. Moreover, findings will foster new lines of investigation for reducing risk of diet related conditions and for developing novel behavioral and pharmacological avenues of treatment and prevention. The proposed research is aligned with the overall mission of the National Institutes of Health to promote health and disease prevention. The findings from this study will ultimately lead to the development of personalized interventions for individuals with obesity and concurrent taste and smell alterations. Lastly, approaches included in this proposal are innovative and highly applicable to other complex health phenomena in which biological variations in inflammation and taste and smell perception impact an individual s health.

Endpoints:

Primary Endpoint: The primary dependent measures for this study are taste and olfaction measures.

Secondary Endpoints: Secondary measures include inflammatory markers, exosomes, microbiota, gene expression, DNA methylation, biological measures and personal factors.",Obesity,,,OBSERVATIONAL,RECRUITING,2022-05-11,2026-12-31,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),350,18 Years - 65 Years,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04714892,0,076cb37900b37fe425bc97592e024f4f,2025-09-16 10:24:08
