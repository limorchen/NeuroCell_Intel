NCT07295067,Extracellular Vesicles for the Treatment of Syringomyelia,"This is a open-label, single-arm, dose escalation phase I clinical trial. The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Intrathecal injection human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicle (hUC-MSC-sEV) in syringomyelia.",Syringomyelia,Exosomes group,PHASE1,,RECRUITING,,,,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07295067,0,2025-12-28 13:48:03,0.6537,0.6537,NO

NCT07227740,Testosterone Deficiency and Endothelial Dysfunction After Spinal Cord Injury,"Heart attacks and strokes are among the most common causes of premature death in individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI) and appear to occur earlier in life. The factors that lead to the heighten and accelerated risk of heart attacks and strokes in adults living with SCI remain poorly understood. The investigators aim to uncover why this happens and find ways to prevent it. Our research focuses on how important cells which line blood vessels, called endothelial cells, function after SCI. The investigators test endothelial function in live conscious people with SCI. The investigators also study signaling molecules endothelial cells release called endothelial cell derived microvesicles (EMVs), which the investigators can measure in blood to tell us the health of endothelial cells. By using these rigorous tests of vascular function, the investigators have determined that endothelial cells appear dysfunctional after SCI. The investigators also know that many men with SCI have low testosterone levels. Our team has studied testosterone's effects on endothelial dysfunction and believe low testosterone may be contributing to endothelial dysfunction after SCI. By understanding these mechanisms, the investigators hope to improve the lives of those living with SCI and reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes. The investigators propose to study the influence of testosterone on endothelial function by using state-of-the-art clinical and laboratory experiments to assess endothelial function in men with SCI with low and normal testosterone levels.",Spinal Cord Injuries; Endothelial Dysfunction; Testosterone Deficiency,Intra-arterial Infusion of Vasoactive Agents; Intra-arterial Vitamin C Infusion; Blood Sampling,,,RECRUITING,,,,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07227740,1,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.3149,0.6149,NO
NCT06138210,The Effect of GD-iExo-003 in Acute Ischemic Stroke,"This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial.

NCT07065409,Treatment of Moyamoya Disease With iPSC-derived Exosomes,"Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disease clinically characterized by chronic progressive stenosis or occlusion at the ends of bilateral internal carotid arteries and the origin of anterior cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries, followed by the formation of abnormal vascular networks at the base of the skull. Clinically, patients with Moyamoya disease mainly present with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and there are two peaks of incidence in children aged 3-5 and middle-aged people aged 40-50. Moreover, as the pathogenesis and treatment evaluation of Moyamoya disease are still in the research trough at present, new discoveries are prone to occur and thus attract a great deal of attention. It not only has a beneficial promoting effect on the treatment and diagnosis of patients, but also makes it easier for research topics to be reported in top journals.

This study intends to combine iPSC-EVs local skin transplantation with temporal muscle application to promote muscle angiogenesis and the establishment of extracranial and intracranial collateral circulation after temporal muscle application. The above-mentioned design features high efficiency, safety and convenience, and is an innovative exploration both at home and abroad. We hope to screen out safe, efficient and simple preparation methods and transplantation methods of iPSC-EVs through systematic experiments, establish an effective clinical evaluation system, and provide auxiliary means for intracranial and extracranial blood flow reconstruction surgery in the treatment of Moyamoya disease. Moreover, in terms of topic selection, iPSC is currently one of the most promising directions for innovative treatment worldwide.",Moyamoya Disease,iPSC-EVs,PHASE1,,RECRUITING,,,,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07065409,0,2025-12-28 13:57:48,0.4576,0.4576,NO
